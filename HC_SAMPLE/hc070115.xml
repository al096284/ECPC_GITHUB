I hope that my hon.

What is his view on that matter, bearing in mind the fact that the Government have no central data at all on where trafficked children are?

For instance, Operation Pentameter—a three-month national enforcement operation—identified 84 potential victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation, 12 of whom were minors or children. Through about 343 operations, we have been able to disrupt the problem, but it remains a very serious matter to me.<a name="stpa_o1"></a><a name="70115-0001.htm_para1"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="John Reid"--><a name="07011513000027"></a>

I have asked my Cabinet colleagues for an overall review of all data collection relating to criminality. The volume and mobility of criminality and the easy transportation that is possible nowadays mean that we are living in a different age. As illustrated by some of the problems that we face, the old systems have not always been able to cope. Now that that is obvious to me in one particular direction, I want to extend consideration of data collection right across the board. I hope that that will meet the point that the hon.

It is precisely ensuring that correct balance that has caused such prolonged deliberation on my part, but I can assure the hon.

The POPPY project provides secure accommodation and a range of other protective services for women.

It revealed the truly deplorable fact that, of 80 children who had been victims of trafficking and had been taken into care, 48 have gone missing and have never been found.

Overall detection rates remained static at about 27 per cent. in 2006, while the figure for violent crimes reduced from 69 per cent. in 1998 to 50 per cent. Can we be certain that a cash squeeze involving more than £250 million, as set out in the recent Treasury paper on delivering a step change in police productivity, will not mean a real-terms cut in police funding?

It also undermines the sex offenders register, and as a result, it undermines the detection rates that the police can achieve. The public want the police to be able to do their job, and as a result they want to know three things: what has gone wrong in this fiasco, who is responsible, and what will be done about it? As the answers may involve ministerial decisions, it is entirely inappropriate for a civil servant to carry out the inquiry. It is also bogus nonsense to claim that an internal investigation should preclude the public's knowing what happened. Why can the Minister not publish the letters and minutes now?

Since Kate Barker first recommended a planning gain supplement in March 2004 in her review of housing supply, there have been 40 parliamentary questions, four public consultation documents, a Select Committee inquiry report and a Government response. Along with the Minister for Housing and Planning, my hon.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="567"-->One thing that has struck me about this territory is that, although there may be differing views on precisely how to do things—what instruments and policy to use—there is general agreement on a number of important points. There is general agreement that it is right and important that we have a policy, planning and fiscal framework that, in a strong economy, meets the need for more business development and more housing.<a name="stpa_o14"></a><a name="70115-0004.htm_para3"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="John Healey"--><a name="07011513000179"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="567"-->There is also general agreement that it is right and reasonable to extract some of the windfall gain in the value of land that has been granted planning permission. Some of those windfall gains are considerable. Alongside the pre-Budget report in 2005, we published an assessment of the increase in the value per hectare of land in general agricultural use when planning permission was gained. When planning permission is granted in England for land for housing development, there can be an average uplift of<br><meta name="Date" content="15 Jan 2007"><notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_568"></a><br>250 times. That is not through any investment from the owner of that land, but just because they happen to own it. It is public policy—in other words, the application of a planning consent—that is the source of that significant rise. The typical uplift is similar, although lower, for industrial and warehousing use. The increase in land value can be about 70 times, on average. For general business use, it might be 80 times.<a name="st_o134"></a><a name="07011513000180"></a>

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="568"-->In pursuing the goals that I have set out, the Government have considered the matter and accepted Kate Barker's recommendation that a modest levy on windfall gains in the value of land going through the planning process would be a fair and effective way not only of helping to finance additional investment that is needed in infrastructure, but of sharing the benefits of development growth with local communities. Just as Kate Barker did, the Government have considered a range of alternatives. We will continue to do so, but at this point the PGS is our lead option. That is because a workable and effective planning gain supplement would have more potential to generate much needed investment throughout the UK than its main alternatives, such as an optional planning charge or a tariff scheme; because the PGS would be proportionate to the land value uplift of a site, and thus fairer for developers and landowners; because the PGS would be more transparent and consistently applied than the existing system of developer contributions; and because the PGS would provide local communities,<br><meta name="Date" content="15 Jan 2007"><notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_569"></a><br>which would receive at least 70 per cent. of the revenue derived from their areas, with the scope to plan and pool resources strategically to fund infrastructure in support of growth.<a name="st_o138"></a><a name="07011513000186"></a>

However, this measure is simply a paving Bill that authorises the three parties to incur preparatory expenditure, although the burden of building the administrative systems and, ultimately, of managing the planning gain supplement would fall on Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs.<br><meta name="Date" content="15 Jan 2007"><notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_570"></a><br><a name="stpa_o18"></a><a name="70115-0005.htm_para2"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="John Healey"--><a name="07011513000191"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="570"-->HMRC's expenditure prior to introduction would include spending on new information technology for the PGS, as well as on the adaptation of its existing systems. The expenditure would also go towards designing the necessary business systems to administer the levy and putting in place appropriately skilled staff to manage it, and it would equip the Valuation Office Agency and the Valuation and Lands Agency in Northern Ireland with the necessary facilities to help to administer the PGS, including staffing, training, accommodation and IT equipment.<a name="stpa_o19"></a><a name="70115-0005.htm_para3"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="John Healey"--><a name="07011513000192"></a>

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="570"-->The final decision on whether to introduce the planning gain supplement awaits the completion of the current round of consultation. The Bill is needed in advance of that decision, so that if an affirmative decision is taken later this year, the Government can start immediately to build the IT and administrative systems to support the planning gain supplement. I think that the hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack) would accept that for such a system it is imperative that we get the IT absolutely right, and to do so HMRC and its IT partners require sufficient lead time to build and test the systems properly. By introducing the Bill now, I am seeking to avoid a situation in which a decision to progress with the planning gain supplement is taken this year, but the authority to start designing and building the necessary systems is not in place. The hon. Gentleman, who is an expert in parliamentary matters, will have recognised immediately that if we introduced the Bill later in the year, and parliamentary business fell in a particular way, the parliamentary calendar might not allow the timely enactment of the measure.

The measure is, in effect, a paving Bill, although the Minister said that it supports a lead option. It consists of just three clauses, but it is nevertheless important, as it permits preliminary expenditure related to the proposed introduction of the Chancellor's planning gain supplement—PGS—in 2009. According to the section headed “Financial Effects of the Bill” in the explanatory notes, which have been prepared by the Treasury, expenditure under the Bill could exceed £50 million. That sum represents the combined cost of project staff in Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, the Valuation Office Agency and its Northern Ireland equivalent, and of new information technology systems which, as the Minister partly admitted, are often notoriously difficult to introduce on time and on budget.<a name="stpa_o24"></a><a name="70115-0005.htm_para8"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Mark Francois"--><a name="07011513000210"></a>

I am happy to be debating these matters with the Financial Secretary, whom I commend for his usual courtesy in giving way so often. We had anticipated the possibility of debating the Bill with his colleague, the Economic Secretary—but even if the Economic Secretary is not present in person, I sense that he is here in spirit. I therefore look forward to debating these matters with the Minister for Housing and Planning instead.<a name="stpa_o25"></a><a name="70115-0005.htm_para9"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Mark Francois"--><a name="07011513000211"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="572"-->There are several reasons why we oppose the planning gain supplement, and the Bill, which commits appreciable sums of public money in order to facilitate it, even before the Government have taken a firm decision to go ahead, poses problems for us. The first is<br><meta name="Date" content="15 Jan 2007"><notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_573"></a><br>that the planning gain supplement is designed to be centrally collected and then redistributed according to Government fiat. Under the Treasury's concept, which is referenced in the explanatory notes and fleshed out at least a little further in the associated consultation documents, of which there have been several, the PGS will be redistributed from the centre, with an element going to the regional bodies and the remainder supposedly being given back to the local authority that permitted the development. The Minister gave us an indicative figure of 70 per cent. this afternoon.<a name="stpa_o26"></a><a name="70115-0005.htm_para10"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Mark Francois"--><a name="07011513000212"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="573"-->However, the Bill provides no guarantee that that will be the case. It is certainly not written into the Bill. Moreover, the Select Committee on Communities and Local Government, which examined the issue in detail in November 2006, pointed out in its report the prospect of a funding formula of some kind being used to determine how much revenue should be returned to each local authority. The Government's record of collecting centrally and redistributing locally in recent years leaves much to be desired, to put it mildly. All those who witnessed the effect of the changes several years ago in another funding formula, the key local government one, from standard spending assessment to formula spending share—from SSA to FSS, as it is known—saw how the formula was altered in order to benefit predominantly urban authorities in the midlands and the north of England.<a name="stpa_o27"></a><a name="70115-0005.htm_para11"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Mark Francois"--><a name="07011513000213"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="573"-->Even if the Government were minded initially to redirect all of what one might call the local authority component straight back to the authority in question, many of us on the Opposition Benches wonder how long it would be before the measure incorporated some element of top-slicing, floors and ceilings, resource equalisation or some similar formula or criteria, so that Ministers could begin to interfere with the straight passporting of the money back to the authority that had been asked to accept the development in question. Experience of the Government to date suggests that that would be the case, and we are understandably sceptical as a result.<a name="st_o155"></a><a name="07011513000214"></a>

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="574"-->Our second reservation is based on the fact that a significant element of the proposed planning gain supplement to be facilitated by the Bill will be regionally administered. In the real world, if we  want to persuade communities to accept further development, we must carry people with us. That means persuading them that they will see genuine visible benefits coming back to them from agreeing to further building in their area. A system administered on a regional basis does little to provide reassurance that that will happen. For instance, a community in Kent could be asked to accept 1,000 additional houses in return for taxation that flows into the Treasury and is regionally redirected towards a bus shelter scheme in Buckinghamshire, remote from the original community that was asked to accept the development. Indeed, under questioning this afternoon, the Financial Secretary has admitted that that regional component of the PGS might even not go back to the original region. The Government have been keen to hide the point that it might be sent to another region, but the House of Commons has exposed that point in debate.<a name="stpa_o29"></a><a name="70115-0005.htm_para13"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Francois"--><a name="07011513000219"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="574"-->As the regions currently have few meaningful tax-raising powers, the PGS is partially a device to raise money that they can then spend. It is also likely to make them pro-development, even in areas that do not warrant it, in order to receive their share of the prospective PGS revenue in return. As the Chartered Institute of Taxation has pointed out:<a name="70115-0005.htm_brev0"></a><a name="07011513000345"></a><ul><p class="tabletext">“We think that the law of unintended consequences will apply, with the result that the proposals will not deliver the Government's policy objectives without a major element of compulsion being applied to local planning authorities to allow developments that they do not wish to allow.”</ul><a name="st_o159"></a><a name="07011513000220"></a>

In his opening speech, the Financial Secretary suggested that there would be circumstances in which, because of proximity to the area where the levy was applied and the need for investment in an adjoining area in a different region, there might be a strong case for allocating some of the funds across regional boundaries.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="575"-->The third reason why we oppose the Bill—and the PGS, which it helps to facilitate—is the threat that it would pose to the creation of affordable housing. That point was largely overlooked in the partial regulatory impact assessment, which is mentioned in the explanatory notes, and was issued alongside the pre-Budget report of 2005. The Government have been understandably coy about explaining the level at which the PGS will bite. Page 3 of the Treasury technical consultation document states that the PGS will be levied at a “modest” rate across the United Kingdom. Unfortunately, it does not say quite how modest that rate will be, so it is difficult to calculate the exact effect at this stage. Nothing in the Bill or the explanatory notes answers that important question. Nevertheless, by working from first principles we can deduce at least some of the effects that the measures might have.<a name="stpa_o34"></a><a name="70115-0006.htm_para2"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Francois"--><a name="07011513000232"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="575"-->It is true that developers often make considerable profit margins, particularly on greenfield housing schemes where there are no significant land clearance costs, so up to a point the PGS could theoretically be absorbed within the developer's profit margin. However, it is not always that simple. In many urban<br><meta name="Date" content="15 Jan 2007"><notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_576"></a><br>areas, many of the most obvious brownfield sites are already, in effect, long gone. That means that developers may have to look at less easy sites such as old gasworks or factory sites, many of which have significant clearance costs, often for good reasons of health and safety, before construction work can begin.<a name="st_o167"></a><a name="07011513000233"></a>

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="577"-->I have criticised the Bill and the Government's approach, and I shall now say something about our preferred approach. It is important to stress that Conservative Members support the concept that developers should make an adequate contribution to infrastructure in return for being allowed to build. Development such as extra housing can help provide relief to those in housing need but, conversely, it often imposes additional pressures on local communities. For example, it can put pressure on school places, medical infrastructure—especially given the crisis in the national health service—and transport infrastructure. It is important that developers make an adequate contribution to alleviating those pressures in return for being allowed to build so that they do not adversely affect existing residents' quality of life.

I fully understand that this is not, therefore, an occasion for a full debate on the PGS proposals, not least because they have not yet been fully defined. However, it is not adequate to nod through the Bill on the basis that we shall, if the Government decide to proceed with the PGS, have a full opportunity to debate the pros and cons of the proposals in the substantive Bill. A great deal of work will have been undertaken by then that will both contribute to the architecture of the PGS proposal and provide the momentum to take it forward. Many of us can already hear the arguments being advanced—namely, that with all the expenditure of working the scheme out having been incurred, it would be wasteful to abandon or radically revise it at that later stage.<a name="stpa_o47"></a><a name="70115-0006.htm_para15"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Nick Raynsford"--><a name="07011513000258"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="579"-->It is therefore right that we should attend today to exactly what a PGS scheme might achieve, how it might work and what impact it might have on development activity. We also need to consider how the PGS might affect the funding of any infrastructure, environmental and social works that are necessary to complement or mitigate development, and how that might compare with alternative mechanisms for achieving those goals.<a name="stpa_o48"></a><a name="70115-0006.htm_para16"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Nick Raynsford"--><a name="07011513000259"></a>

That is not because I disagree with the objective; on the contrary, I wholly favour effective mechanisms for capturing a proportion of the gain that accrues from the development process for the benefit of the wider community and to finance necessary infrastructure, social provision or environmental mitigation. However, we must recognise that that is easier said than done.<a name="stpa_o49"></a><a name="70115-0006.htm_para17"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Nick Raynsford"--><a name="07011513000260"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="579"-->The history of post-war Britain is littered with the wrecks of abortive attempts to achieve that objective, first in the 1940s, then in the 1960s and again in the 1970s.

Against such a background, one would at the very least urge extreme caution before venturing again into such territory. I am not sure whether my right hon. and hon. Friends have been complimented by their civil servants on their bravery in introducing the measure, but they will recognise the double-edged meaning implicit in that.<a name="stpa_o50"></a><a name="70115-0006.htm_para18"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Nick Raynsford"--><a name="07011513000261"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="580"-->Why did the previous attempts not succeed? Essentially, there were three reasons. First, the legislation was of necessity complex, as were the processes for defining the uplift in value and hence the tax liability, which were therefore not difficult for sophisticated developers to evade. Secondly, the measures were seen as being anti-development, so developers' natural instinct was to postpone schemes until the threat of the tax had passed. That was possible because, thirdly, the Opposition of the day had pledged to repeal such measures if they got back into power, and they did so in each case.<a name="stpa_o51"></a><a name="70115-0006.htm_para19"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Nick Raynsford"--><a name="07011513000262"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="580"-->I am not suggesting that all those scenarios apply now; the last certainly does not. However, enough of them apply to sound alarm bells. The inherent complexity of the proposal means that evasion will not be an unattainable objective. On the contrary, most informed commentators suggest that, if PGS is implemented, a small army of consultants will emerge, advising developers and landowners on how best to minimise or avoid their liability. The view of the development industry is generally hostile to PGS, so there will be all sorts of incentives to structure schemes to minimise liability.<a name="stpa_o52"></a><a name="70115-0006.htm_para20"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Nick Raynsford"--><a name="07011513000263"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="580"-->There are two key issues. First, as was implied by my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary in moving Second Reading, setting PGS relatively low will reduce the disincentive effect that undoubtedly applied to the earlier measures, in which a very high—indeed, penal—rate of taxation was involved. I fully understand that the Government have not reached their view on a figure, but I happily acknowledge that a PGS of, say, 20 per cent. would be less likely to deter development than a tax at 100 per cent. However, I am not sure that developers will decline to explore the scope to reduce or even eliminate their liability. There is huge scope for that, not just in the inherently complex nature of the scheme, but in the varied circumstances affecting the valuation of different sites.<a name="stpa_o53"></a><a name="70115-0007.htm_para0"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Nick Raynsford"--><a name="07011513000264"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="580"-->That takes me to the second key issue: the point at which the tax will bite. The PGS is predicated on the assumption that the main enhancement in value comes when planning permission is given. That is true in some cases, but in others the picture is much more complex. I leave aside all sorts of issues of hope value and other such factors and focus on two circumstances. There is sometimes a need for substantial land remediation costs before a site can be developed, or for infrastructure investment to give access to the site before the true value can be derived. Without the Jubilee line extension, the Greenwich peninsula in my constituency would not have been developable because, essentially, it was not accessible. Putting in the infrastructure of the Jubilee line was far more important to uplifting the value of the land than any grant of planning permission, irrespective of the infrastructure investment. That is where there is<br><meta name="Date" content="15 Jan 2007"><notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_581"></a><br>enormous scope for developers, with their advisers, to examine, explore and exploit opportunities to argue that it is not the granting of planning permission that explains the uplift in value, but the process of development, the enhancement of access, the remediation of the land, the opportunities to develop and the process.<a name="stpa_o54"></a><a name="70115-0007.htm_para1"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Nick Raynsford"--><a name="07011513000265"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="581"-->In many developments, a period of relatively discounted low-value rents is necessary to attract people to the site. The true values are achieved only several years down the line, when the site is seen to be working. However, PGS is predicated on the assumption that it bites when the planning consent is granted, not on the ultimate development value of the site. There are serious questions about whether this measure is the most effective way to capture development value and real risks that canny developers will find easy opportunities to evade liability.<a name="stpa_o55"></a><a name="70115-0007.htm_para2"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Nick Raynsford"--><a name="07011513000266"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="581"-->That brings me to the nub of the problem: past development taxes have generally failed because developers have seen no advantage in making the required contribution. On the contrary, they have sought to evade liability—and look set to do just the same with PGS. By contrast, section 106 contributions, despite the problems associated with them, to which I shall return in a moment, are often paid willingly by developers when they see the money being used to create a better environment for their development. That has very much been my experience in Greenwich, where my local authority raised substantial sums under section 106 from developer contributions to major local schemes such as the Greenwich peninsula or the Woolwich arsenal. The developers have been willing to agree such contributions because they can see direct benefits: better transport arrangements to serve the site, new schools, parks or health facilities that will make the development more attractive to potential investors. In short, the section 106 framework has worked for us because it has offered a win-win outcome as a result of which both parties have seen clear advantages, so there has been no incentive to try to evade the contribution.<a name="stpa_o56"></a><a name="70115-0007.htm_para3"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Nick Raynsford"--><a name="07011513000267"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="581"-->I recognise that that does not apply in all cases. The experience of section 106 is patchy: the mechanism has worked in some areas but not in others. Developers have been critical of many local authorities for making unrealistic demands or allowing the process to drag on, so delaying much needed development. Equally, some critics have demonstrated that local authority enthusiasm and indeed capacity for negotiating section 106 agreements has been variable and that some authorities have failed to secure appropriate contributions<a name="stpa_o57"></a><a name="70115-0007.htm_para4"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Nick Raynsford"--><a name="07011513000268"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="581"-->The conclusion that I draw, as was implied by my question to my hon. Friend the Minister, is that the section 106 process can and should be improved. The sharing of good practice and the development of appropriate support and advisory services to help local authorities negotiate section 106 agreements is obviously one way in which to improve outputs. Irrespective of the Government's decision on PGS, that will be necessary, because—as my hon. Friend conceded—a continuing, albeit reduced, remit for section 106 is envisaged under the Government's proposals.<br><meta name="Date" content="15 Jan 2007"><notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_582"></a><br><a name="stpa_o58"></a><a name="70115-0007.htm_para5"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Nick Raynsford"--><a name="07011513000269"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="582"-->If such improvements can be achieved—and in my view there is no reason why the poorer-performing local authorities cannot be helped to up their game to reach the level of the best—an obvious question is raised about why the Government are proposing to introduce a complex, unproven and potentially risky new task that may well end up raising contributions that are less than those that could be achieved under a properly functioning section 106 arrangement. A study undertaken by Knight Frank that was reported in<i> Regeneration and Renewal</i> last September suggested exactly that scenario—a lower yield for PGS than for a properly working section 106 system.<a name="stpa_o59"></a><a name="70115-0007.htm_para6"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Nick Raynsford"--><a name="07011513000270"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="582"-->The traditional section 106 route is, of course, not the only option for securing developer contributions to infrastructure or social and environmental investment. There have been some very interesting developments involving tariff systems, sometimes described as “roof tax”. Perhaps the best-known example is the Milton Keynes system. Under those arrangements, developers are required to pay a fixed sum per home or per square metre of commercial space to finance additional community needs such as transport, health, education, environmental improvement and social housing.<a name="stpa_o60"></a><a name="70115-0007.htm_para7"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Nick Raynsford"--><a name="07011513000271"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="582"-->The evidence to date suggests that developers are generally willing to enter into such agreements when they are certain of the benefits that will flow from the use of the funds that are necessary to complement and ensure the success of their development. I am aware that such an arrangement may not work everywhere. The special circumstances in Milton Keynes, which is in a defined growth area with a clear pipeline of future expansion and where land prices are generally pretty comparable throughout, make it especially suitable for such an approach. However, there is growing interest in different means of securing appropriate developer contributions within the existing legal framework. Evidence suggests that the sums being raised are growing. It seems curious that, just when there appear to be good prospects of securing the objectives that lie behind the Government's proposal by existing means, attention may be diverted by the introduction of a radical and controversial new tax.<a name="stpa_o61"></a><a name="70115-0007.htm_para8"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Nick Raynsford"--><a name="07011513000272"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="582"-->Given the uncertainties and risks implicit in the route on which they are embarking, I urge caution on my right hon. and hon. Friends. Whatever gloss their officials may try to put on the outcome of the earlier consultation, the reality is that the majority of informed opinion is not in favour of PGS. Nor is it a case of vested interests. The local authorities that may have the most experience of negotiating successful section 106 agreements with developers are as wary of the PGS proposals as the development industry. The Royal Town Planning Institute, of which I am proud to be an honorary fellow, described the proposals in somewhat stark terms in a press release headed “Government ‘sleep-walking' into unworkable new tax”.<a name="stpa_o62"></a><a name="70115-0007.htm_para9"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Nick Raynsford"--><a name="07011513000273"></a>

It is also a bad idea because it is potentially centralising. Effectively, the Government will be top-slicing section 106 money. It interposes Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs in an area where many local planning authorities have already developed substantial expertise in judging the optimum level of planning gain that they can seek. It sits alongside proposals for the reform of the planning system that will suck out much of the decision-making authority that councils currently have<a name="stpa_o64"></a><a name="70115-0007.htm_para11"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Vincent Cable"--><a name="07011513000276"></a>

There is a growing view, certainly among liberal, or market, economists, that the right way forward is taxation of land values, as opposed to development betterment. That view is shared by thinking organisations on the centre-left: the Institute for Public Policy Research has produced a very good case. The Government had an opportunity to open up this whole argument. I accept that it is big, radical and complicated in itself, but by focusing on one very narrow aspect of land taxation—and probably the most difficult and unattractive aspect—the Government might well undermine that potentially important development.<a name="st_o181"></a><a name="07011513000277"></a>

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="584"-->What is being proposed is also a bad idea because it does not give us sufficient detail to talk about the planning gain supplement properly. I understand the Minister's difficulty in setting the rate, but the rate issue is fundamental to how we debate the matter. Its history has been partially rehearsed. It is one of Governments experimenting with very different levels of development taxation. The first experiment was the proposals of Lloyd George and Winston Churchill almost exactly 100 years ago: there was a development tax of 20 per cent. but the proposals were not introduced because of difficulties with another place on a wider subject. The Attlee Government had the confiscatory 100 per cent. There was then Wilson mark 1 and Wilson mark 2, which had rates of 40 per cent. and 80 per cent. respectively, and the Thatcher Government initially experimented with 60 per cent.<a name="stpa_o66"></a><a name="70115-0007.htm_para13"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Cable"--><a name="07011513000280"></a>

Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois) was coy about doing.<a name="stpa_o68"></a><a name="70115-0007.htm_para15"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Cable"--><a name="07011513000282"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="584"-->On the basic principle, most of us will agree that the Financial Secretary is right in saying that there is a very powerful philosophical case for taxing betterment and the windfall that accrues through no greater effort than achieving a change in planning status. The right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) wrote an article some time ago in which he mounted a spirited case against that principle, based on his experiences as Secretary of State for the Environment, but as he is not here it is probably unfair to drag him into the debate. I think that there is a general acceptance among those present that the principle of taxing betterment development value is right, but the problem is that there are already other ways of doing that.<a name="stpa_o69"></a><a name="70115-0007.htm_para16"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Cable"--><a name="07011513000283"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="584"-->Section 106 and adaptations of it have been discussed at length, but what has not been mentioned is that capital gains tax does the same thing—it taxes windfall capital gains. The objection to relying on CGT is made in the Government's consultation paper, which says that its effect is severely undermined by the various<br><meta name="Date" content="15 Jan 2007"><notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_585"></a><br>allowances and reliefs. The logical response to that is to tighten up on the allowances and reliefs, which I would suggest doing for wider tax reasons. At present, there are not just one but two ways of taxing betterment: section 106 and CGT.<a name="stpa_o70"></a><a name="70115-0007.htm_para17"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Cable"--><a name="07011513000284"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="585"-->That brings us to what is essentially a practical argument: whether section 106, as adapted—the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich suggested how that might be done—compares with the planning gain supplement concept. The arguments against section 106 have been well made and the Financial Secretary repeated some of them. In its worst expressions, it is arbitrary and inconsistent and can be long-winded. Examples from across the country—particularly from the early 1990s, when section 106 was first experimented with—show that all those arguments are true, but it has two enormous attractions: it is purely local and it is reformable.<a name="stpa_o71"></a><a name="70115-0007.htm_para18"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Cable"--><a name="07011513000285"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="585"-->This situation strikes me as odd, particularly as the Minister for Housing and Planning is sitting alongside the Financial Secretary today. The former Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, and now the Department for Communities and Local Government, expended a lot of effort on trying to persuade local authorities that good practice could be built on. Circular 1/97 was an example, and another circular, in December 2003, also explained how good practice could be built on. It is not at all clear that the Treasury and the DCLG are entirely at one on this issue. The former ODPM was very clear that the system was capable of being improved considerably, and some of us are disappointed that that effort has not been carried through.<a name="stpa_o72"></a><a name="70115-0007.htm_para19"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Cable"--><a name="07011513000286"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="585"-->I could understand why the Government want to argue that that system should be superseded if there were a simple, clear and easy way of extracting development value for the taxpayer that does not happen at the moment, but it is clear that the planning gain supplement does not do that. I do not want to speak at length on this issue, as some of the points have already been made, but there are several specific ways in which it fails. First, it fails in terms of valuation issues, as the hon. Member for Watford has already pointed out several times. In part, the problem is how it is possible in practice to crystallise a transaction in such a way that the planning gain supplement can apply in a simple way. A big development will have lots of different and related planning applications. As we know from the work of our local authorities, in practice, big and complex projects often involve a necessarily long planning process, during which there is discussion of planning conditions. It is not at all clear how a single point and a single owner can be identified for tax purposes.<a name="stpa_o73"></a><a name="70115-0007.htm_para20"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Cable"--><a name="07011513000287"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="585"-->The underlying measure that the Government propose is self-assessment, which, although it is counter-intuitive, is in fact right and a good idea. Clearly, people will not underestimate the value of their own land if at some point the Government can compulsorily acquire it at the volunteered value. What the Government have never clarified is how the system of self-assessment would be backed up by the compulsory purchase powers that would be necessary to make it effective. Valuation is possible, and self-assessment is a possible mechanism, but there is much more to it than simply saying that people should declare the value of their own development.<br><meta name="Date" content="15 Jan 2007"><notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_586"></a><br><a name="st_o183"></a><a name="07011513000288"></a>

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="586"-->Valuation is one issue and the other is the impact on development, and the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich explained clearly the possible problems. It is straightforward if we are talking about greenfield development, but if it is brownfield development, with unpredictable and complex costs relating to contaminated sites, it becomes much more difficult.<a name="stpa_o75"></a><a name="70115-0007.htm_para22"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Cable"--><a name="07011513000291"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="586"-->The other area that no one has so far mentioned, in which the impact becomes unpredictable and difficult, relates to the improvement of property rather than the redevelopment of the land. A case could arise in which extensive internal improvements of a big office block or a factory could take place without incurring planning gain supplement because they are internal, but external cladding, which would require planning approval, would be subject to the planning gain supplement. Or a developer who wished to install a new, big lift development to comply with the disability discrimination provisions might also be subject to planning gain supplement. There are many complex areas in which development might be deterred or distorted by the working of the supplement.<a name="stpa_o76"></a><a name="70115-0007.htm_para23"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Cable"--><a name="07011513000292"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="586"-->The third problem area, which has also not yet been mentioned, is what I call the spill-over problem. Often, the main gains from development do not accrue to the developer, but to the neighbours. That is most obviously the case in big projects such as the Jubilee line or the creation of a new town. Everybody in the vicinity benefits from the rise in the value of land, but it is only the developer who is taxed. That is also a problem with section 106, but it is an underlying problem with taxing development rather than land that that anomaly continues.<a name="stpa_o77"></a><a name="70115-0007.htm_para24"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Cable"--><a name="07011513000293"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="586"-->Fourthly, we have the problem of double taxation. As I have already said, developers are taxed capital gains tax on appreciating capital values, as well as section 106. The Government are clearly aware of the problem and are talking about allowing the new planning gain supplement to be used as a tax offset for those other taxes, which potentially creates enormous complexity and undermines the whole pursuit of yield. The sheer difficulty of trying to administer separate systems of taxation alongside each other is formidable.<a name="stpa_o78"></a><a name="70115-0007.htm_para25"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Cable"--><a name="07011513000294"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="586"-->In conclusion, I shall talk about alternatives. The Financial Secretary rightly challenged the Opposition parties, asking what we would do. I would do several things. As the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich said, we know now that it is possible—based on the experiences of Milton Keynes, west Berkshire<br><meta name="Date" content="15 Jan 2007"><notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_587"></a><br>and the City of London—to introduce tariff-based systems that are transparent and satisfy both the local authorities and the developers. It is striking that the development industry has expressed its confidence in tariff-based systems, which is a big step forward.<a name="stpa_o79"></a><a name="70115-0007.htm_para26"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Cable"--><a name="07011513000295"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="587"-->Secondly, I would reform capital gains tax, dealing especially with some of the reliefs. I notice that the chairman or chief executive of British Land recently announced in the property press that he had been able to achieve a gain of some £18 million as a result of taper relief and holding on to his property assets for substantial periods of time. That is the kind of relief that the Government should consider if they intend to reform taxation in that area.<a name="stpa_o80"></a><a name="70115-0007.htm_para27"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Cable"--><a name="07011513000296"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="587"-->Thirdly, I would look further into value added tax. My party has long argued that we need to equalise VAT between home improvements and new residences. If that were to happen, the VAT on new development would capture some of the development gain, while reducing VAT on home improvements would enhance the incentive to increase the housing stock of older property, where much of the potential for increasing supply exists.<a name="stpa_o81"></a><a name="70115-0007.htm_para28"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Cable"--><a name="07011513000297"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="587"-->Finally, we would want to look further into the whole principle of taxing land values. It is a difficult area and the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) has already intervened to point out some of the obvious political problems, but it is worth quoting one or two of the leading authorities in the field. John Muellbauer, for example, who is widely used as a consultant by the Government, a few days ago commented:<a name="70115-0007.htm_brev1"></a><a name="07011513000354"></a><ul><p class="tabletext">“I think a planning gains supplement is a pretty dumb idea: it's been tried five times and each time it failed... A land tax, levied in proportion to the total value of the land, would be much more practical, and more likely to tame Britain's boom-bust housing market”.</ul><a name="stpa_o82"></a><a name="70115-0007.htm_para29"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Cable"--><a name="07011513000298"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="587"-->In the<i> Financial Times,</i> Martin Wolf recently said:<a name="70115-0008.htm_brev0"></a><a name="07011513000355"></a><ul><p class="tabletext">“Land taxation is the natural, efficient and just way to finance the capital cost of infrastructure.”</ul><a name="stpa_o83"></a><a name="70115-0008.htm_para0"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Cable"--><a name="07011513000299"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="587"-->Clearly, there is considerable academic and practical support for the proposal. I fully acknowledge the difficulties, many of them political, but at the very least it is worth exploring through borough-wide experiments and research. Since this is a paving Bill and is designed to advance knowledge rather than implement taxation, it is a disappointment—to say the least—that the Government have not been willing to encompass within it the wider issues of the taxation of land.<a name="ordayhd_4"></a><a name="70115-0008.htm_ordayhd0"></a><a name="07011513000361"></a>XZXZomit desc="time"YWYW5.6 pmXZXZ/omitYWYW<a name="st_o185"></a><a name="07011513000300"></a>

The Minister mentioned the report of the Select Committee—I am pleased to be a member—which went into the Government's proposals in some detail, analysed the issues and highlighted some areas of concern where we believed more work needed to be done. I was very pleased indeed when I read the Government's response to our<br><meta name="Date" content="15 Jan 2007"><notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_588"></a><br>report, as virtually every item featured the word “agree” or “accept” or otherwise pointed out that more work was necessary along the lines suggested by the Select Committee.<a name="stpa_o84"></a><a name="70115-0008.htm_para1"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Clive Betts"--><a name="07011513000301"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="588"-->The Select Committee did not inquire into alternative systems, but we made a request before the Government eventually reached a view about the way forward and decided whether a planning gain supplement was necessary. We said:<a name="70115-0008.htm_brev1"></a><a name="07011513000356"></a><ul><p class="tabletext">“Such consideration should include comparative cost-benefit analyses of PGS and scaled-back Section 106 arrangements on the one hand and, on the other, a fully effective utilisation by local authorities of Section 106 powers, including possible reforms and enhancements.”</ul><a name="stpa_o85"></a><a name="70115-0008.htm_para2"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Clive Betts"--><a name="07011513000302"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="588"-->We were informing the Government that, as a Select Committee, we had not come down on one side or the other and that before they reached an absolute view on whether to proceed with PGS—the Minister said today that such a view has not yet been reached—they should conduct a comparative analysis.<a name="stpa_o86"></a><a name="70115-0008.htm_para3"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Clive Betts"--><a name="07011513000303"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="588"-->I see the hon. Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois) nodding his head, but that is rather strange, as he has adopted precisely the opposite position, saying that the Opposition will rule out planning gain supplement before the detailed comparative analysis has been done and before he sees the Government's work on it. He told the House that the Opposition were not in a position to propose alternative policies. Presumably, that means that he has not done all his working out and that the Opposition have not reached a final view on the subject, so how can he rule out PGS when he has not yet established whether an alternative, enhanced and reformed section 106 provision is practical and workable?<a name="stpa_o87"></a><a name="70115-0008.htm_para4"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Clive Betts"--><a name="07011513000304"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="588"-->We are debating what is practical and workable. It seems that there is general agreement across the House that, because we do not have a free market in land and because land value is enhanced when public authorities give planning permission for development, an element of increased value is the result of a public authority decision, so it should be returned to the public purse in some way. What we are arguing about now is the mechanism by which that should happen.<a name="stpa_o88"></a><a name="70115-0008.htm_para5"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Clive Betts"--><a name="07011513000305"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="588"-->The section 106 system clearly does not work perfectly. It works on some occasions, in some ways, in some local authorities. I asked parliamentary questions and received a lot of information about how section 106 arrangements are dealt with in different authorities across the country, how many affordable homes are being built, and what other revenue has been raised by the authorities. The reality is that the position is extremely patchy. We could look at trying to improve the way in which local authorities use section 106. Even with the Government's proposals on the PGS, there will be a residual section 106 issue in relation to affordable housing, so we ought to look at that issue in any case.<a name="stpa_o89"></a><a name="70115-0008.htm_para6"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Clive Betts"--><a name="07011513000306"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="588"-->There is a problem with section 106. It was initially designed to look at the immediate consequences of a development in terms of infrastructure needs specifically related to it and adjacent to it. It does  not deal very well with the provision of wider infrastructure needs in an area and it certainly does not deal very well with cases in which those needs cross local authority boundaries and regional boundaries. There are some real problems there. From the answers<br><meta name="Date" content="15 Jan 2007"><notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_589"></a><br>of Opposition Front Benchers, it seems that they have not yet reached a view about how they will deal with that problem if they do not go ahead with the PGS. We have to address that problem—it is a practical issue—because if we do not we will stop infrastructure development occurring, which will itself prevent major development from occurring in the future.<a name="stpa_o90"></a><a name="70115-0008.htm_para7"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Clive Betts"--><a name="07011513000307"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="589"-->I accept that the PGS, as a concept, is much simpler. In essence, as a tax at a flat-rate on increases in value because of planning permission, it should be relatively easy to understand, accept and implement. However, the Select Committee inquiry recognised that there are significant and major complications still to be addressed by the Government in working through how the tax might be implemented in practice. We received many objections, some of which have been referred to in today's debate, from a number of organisations. They expressed concerns about the practicality of the tax. However, the interesting thing is that, when we pushed most of those witnesses in oral evidence in the Committee, although they had concerns about the PGS and how it might work, they had not got any obvious alternatives. There are difficulties.<a name="stpa_o91"></a><a name="70115-0008.htm_para8"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Clive Betts"--><a name="07011513000308"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="589"-->The Milton Keynes tariff has been raised as a possible way forward. It is a relatively simple approach to take. It cannot be avoided, which has an awful lot of merit. However, when pushed, all the witnesses who gave evidence to the Select Committee said that the Milton Keynes tariff worked in Milton Keynes and any other similar area, but most areas are not similar to Milton Keynes. The approach is relatively easy to apply to large-scale housing developments in one local authority. Most areas and most developments are not like that. When the Government legislate, they should be careful that they do not exclude approaches such as the Milton Keynes tariff, because they clearly work in certain areas, but that does not mean to say that such approaches can be applied to other areas.<a name="stpa_o92"></a><a name="70115-0008.htm_para9"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Clive Betts"--><a name="07011513000309"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="589"-->In looking at the way forward, the Opposition seem to imply that somehow it might be a bad thing if any system gave more financial incentives to local authorities to give planning permission for development. That would not be a bad thing at all. One of the problems with our planning system—I have an awful lot of time for the system and the people who operate it on the ground; we often knock it unreasonably—is that local authorities often have incentives not to give planning permission. They incur all the costs and often do not see many benefits. If we can start to look at changing our taxation system so that it gives more financial benefits to local authorities—at least to offset the costs of new developments, whether they be residential or non-residential—that will be an important and appropriate step forward. Listening to what the Opposition say about centralisation, I think that it would also be an appropriate step if, at the same time, we decentralised the business rate and gave that back to local authorities as another incentive for giving planning permission at a local level.<a name="stpa_o93"></a><a name="70115-0008.htm_para10"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Clive Betts"--><a name="07011513000310"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="589"-->It is important that we look at any new scheme that is developed and try to ensure that it increases the revenue that comes to the public purse, particularly when that money is used to fund infrastructure that is necessary for the development to take place in the first place. Equally, it is important that, in an attempt to<br><meta name="Date" content="15 Jan 2007"><notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_590"></a><br>gather money for the public purse, the rate is not set so high that it discourages development in the first place. That is an interesting balance that the Government will have to think about when they come forward with any approach, whether it be setting the rate of the PGS or any new ideas for section 106. Whatever scheme we have, an important requirement will be for a majority of the funds to come back to the local authority area in which the planning permission is given. It must also have an element that can be used to fund infrastructure that is necessary for development on a sub-regional and regional basis. The existing system does not do that well.<a name="stpa_o94"></a><a name="70115-0008.htm_para11"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Clive Betts"--><a name="07011513000311"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="590"-->I should say to the Government that there is a problem with almost all the proposals, because we will often need to put in place the infrastructure that we want to fund before a development can happen, yet the money will come from that development only at a certain point down the line. That would apply to the PGS, because it would be calculated when planning permission was given, but collected only when the development took place, although the infrastructure that would be necessary to make the development happen would have to be funded first. The Government will have to address that because it is a fundamental problem of any system.<a name="stpa_o95"></a><a name="70115-0008.htm_para12"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Clive Betts"--><a name="07011513000312"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="590"-->The Select Committee report rejected the idea of Government being allowed to borrow against future streams of PGS funding. I think that we might have got that wrong because the Government might want to think about making that part of any new system that brings money forward from the value of a development—that value given by the planning permission. Whatever scheme we use, we could allow local authorities to anticipate the revenue to fund the infrastructure that is needed in the first place.<a name="stpa_o96"></a><a name="70115-0008.htm_para13"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Clive Betts"--><a name="07011513000313"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="590"-->An alternative would, of course, be for the Government to create an advance fund from which local authorities could draw to fund the infrastructure. Local authorities could then pay back into that with either the PGS money or enhanced section 106 contributions when they arrive. One or other of those mechanisms, or any such mechanism, is absolutely necessary because none of the proposals made so far gets round that problem. I would be interested to hear the Minister's comments on that.<a name="stpa_o97"></a><a name="70115-0008.htm_para14"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Clive Betts"--><a name="07011513000314"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="590"-->We will also have to consider mechanisms to ensure that we can pull together contributions from several schemes when they occur in different local authority areas—and sometimes in different regions. As my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary said, parts of some local authorities are close to regional boundaries—my city of Sheffield is right next to the east midlands region—and developments can cross regions. The way in which mechanisms can pull contributions from various developments when they are needed to fund combined infrastructure is also important.<a name="stpa_o98"></a><a name="70115-0008.htm_para15"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Clive Betts"--><a name="07011513000315"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="590"-->The Government have a lot of work to do. The Select Committee's report mentioned several aspects of the practicalities of PGS that remain to be resolved: the definitions and calculations of current use value and planning value; the problem of option agreements; the issue of phased and deferred payments; the problems of exemptions, although we asked for fewer exemptions because that would mean fewer complications; and the way in which we deal with transitional arrangements<br><meta name="Date" content="15 Jan 2007"><notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_591"></a><br>from the existing scheme to any new scheme. All those issues need addressing. It is right that Ministers are talking about the process, but it is equally right that they have not committed themselves to a final outcome, because all the details will be important to the success of that final outcome.<a name="stpa_o99"></a><a name="70115-0008.htm_para16"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Clive Betts"--><a name="07011513000316"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="591"-->Ministers are leaving an element of the section 106 mechanism in their proposals for PGS: the funding of affordable housing. It is essential that we recognise the importance of section 106 as the main funder of affordable housing in many parts of the country. It is not always used by local authorities as well or to the extent that it should be, but it still vital. Even if PGS is introduced, we ought to be enhancing local authorities' understanding and use of section 106 for affordable housing.<a name="stpa_o100"></a><a name="70115-0008.htm_para17"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Clive Betts"--><a name="07011513000317"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="591"-->It is equally important that we do not build any perverse incentives into a PGS scheme that encourage local authorities to reduce the amount of section 106 money that is gained for affordable housing to enhance the amount of PGS that is received. If a certain amount of a scheme's section 106 money was extracted for affordable housing, the amount of PGS that was collected would be reduced. We must be careful about the interaction between those two elements in the final scheme.<a name="stpa_o101"></a><a name="70115-0008.htm_para18"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Clive Betts"--><a name="07011513000318"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="591"-->There is a great deal of agreement that it is right in principle that when planning permission given by a public authority increases the value of a piece of land, the public purse should share in that increase in value, especially so that infrastructure developments that are needed as a consequence of that development can be funded. Many complications will need to be resolved whatever scheme we opt for, be it PGS with residual section 106 measures, enhanced section 106 or any other of the proposals that have been mentioned today.<a name="stpa_o102"></a><a name="70115-0008.htm_para19"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Clive Betts"--><a name="07011513000319"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="591"-->I come back to the essential issue of the need to ensure that many of the large-scale developments occur. We have to find ways of ensuring that the up-front funding necessary for infrastructure is found, particularly if money from taxation or contributions from section 106, or whatever scheme is in place, reach the public purse only at a later stage. We must find a way of making sure that the public sector horse is funded first, so that it can drag along the private sector cart. It is not merely on behalf of local authorities that I raise that point; many developers who gave evidence to the Select Committee would articulate those concerns, too. It is important that whatever scheme we eventually come up with, we find ways of ensuring that the infrastructure necessary for development is funded in advance, even if the funding arising from the development is accessed later, when the development actually takes place. I will be interested to hear what Ministers say about the issue, because it is crucial to making sure that we have the development that is necessary to ensuring that our economies and communities move forward.<a name="ordayhd_5"></a><a name="70115-0008.htm_ordayhd1"></a><a name="07011513000362"></a>XZXZomit desc="time"YWYW5.20 pmXZXZ/omitYWYW<a name="st_o186"></a><a name="07011513000320"></a>

The Government gave us what my grandmother would have called “A lick and a promise,” the lick being the Bill, and the promise being what might eventually follow it. My hon. Friends the Members for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman), and for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois), who are on the Opposition Front Bench, gave us a promise without the lick. The Liberal Democrats gave us an effusion of licking and promises, including proposals for a tariff-based system, reform of capital gains tax, changes in VAT and a serious exploration of the land value tax. Despite my teasing of the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable), there are substantial reasons for such an exploration, and what he proposes has been tried in the United States. However, the purpose of such a scheme would be to push people into development. In a sense, it would solve one of the other problems that Barker identified, which is people's reluctance to bring land forward for development. However, if one considers the rate of house price increases since Barker published her report, one wonders to what extent her remedies are relevant, and to what extent they would equalise the rhythm of price rises in Britain and the continent—and that, after all, was why the report was commissioned.<a name="stpa_o104"></a><a name="70115-0008.htm_para21"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. David Curry"--><a name="07011513000322"></a>

I am a member of the Select Committee on Public Accounts, and therefore live on a diet of failed IT systems, and I hope that the Minister will not choose the consultants who gave us the Rural Payments Agency, or some of the other consultants used in the past, to set up the system.

That may be unpalatable, and I accept that people do not want their neighbourhoods and communities to be, in their view, deluged. However, we must build houses where people want to live—there is no escape from that. I do not particularly like the Stalinist approach that the Deputy Prime Minister adopted in his previous incarnation, and the more that the Department tells us how much can be built in the Thames Gateway the more I wonder how long that approach will last.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="593"-->We must acknowledge that populations need infrastructural support. My party has made much of the fact that the Government want to proceed with development, but are thwarted in that aim, because the infrastructure is not in place to transport people to work or to provide the schools, hospitals and roads that are needed for functioning communities. Funding for that infrastructure has not been forthcoming under existing financial arrangements, so there is a bar to development and one cannot imagine any foreseeable changes to the rules. The comprehensive spending review will soon be announced, and the decline in the increase of public expenditure will be the salient political reality of the remainder of this Parliament.<a name="stpa_o107"></a><a name="70115-0008.htm_para24"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Curry"--><a name="07011513000327"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="593"-->Where do we look for the cash? I followed closely the speech of the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford). It is a pleasure to speak in the same debate as him and, once again, to our mutual embarrassment, we find ourselves in substantial agreement. The Kate Barker proposal is not new—it has been endlessly circulated and repeated—so we must ask what would make it work, whether we need a new tax, how well it would marry with other taxes, whether we could do better by building on existing mechanisms, whether the industry will have good reason to work with the proposal, and whether it would yield useful sums. The answer to all those questions is at best open and, at worst, there is a predisposition to a negative response.<a name="stpa_o108"></a><a name="70115-0009.htm_para0"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Curry"--><a name="07011513000328"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="593"-->The Government have made a serious effort to mitigate the full red-bloodedness of the Barker proposals. First, section 106 will not be dethroned, although it is somewhat diminished. That is important, because we depend on section 106 for half of the affordable houses that are built in Britain. We may not be pleased about that, but if we did not have section 106 even fewer houses would be built. Anything that undermines the provision, therefore, is fatal to the cause of affordable housing, as local authorities and developers have gradually developed a great deal of expertise or case law on it. If section 106 were abolished, we would learn to love it. It is a particularly British characteristic to learn to love institutions on their demise. Section 106 is useful, but it must be developed.<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i>I did not catch that sedentary intervention from the hon. Member for<br><meta name="Date" content="15 Jan 2007"><notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_594"></a><br>Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts), but I do not think that we will learn to love the Government on their demise, if that is what it was about.<a name="stpa_o109"></a><a name="70115-0009.htm_para1"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Curry"--><a name="07011513000329"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="594"-->Many small schemes escape the net of section 106, so we should remedy that. The Government have tried to mitigate the proposals by trying to hypothecate 70 per cent. of the yield to local authority areas. I do not wish to be Jesuitical, but a local authority area is a vague concept. Is it in the area of a local authority? Broadly speaking, my local authority is in the Yorkshire and Humberside area. I accept that some infrastructures are adjacent or close to a local authority on which they depend heavily. If a housing estate is built at the southern end of Craven, the infrastructure in Bradford is important. A significant number of Bradford pupils go to school in my constituency, as the biggest comprehensive in North Yorkshire is in south Craven. A major housing development at the Keighley end of Bradford has implications for education across the border in the North Yorkshire education area. I would therefore not want to impose hermetically sealed borders to restrict the use of the money, as that would not make sense. But it would be entirely different if the money from a development in Bentham, at the top left-hand corner of my constituency, where one can practically smell the Irish sea, found its way down to Bradford. The sense of indignation would be considerable. Much depends on a practical, common-sense view—not that it is easy to envisage developments in Bentham that are likely to yield, whichever way the money is taken, the sort of cash that would make a huge difference to Bradford.<a name="stpa_o110"></a><a name="70115-0009.htm_para2"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Curry"--><a name="07011513000330"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="594"-->The Government need to be more precise. We on the Conservative Benches are rather sensitive to the notion of the region. The Minister's constituency is in the Leeds city region. In that context, I can see that people might well perceive some advantage in sharing the products of development, however they are realised, to make that work more.<a name="stpa_o111"></a><a name="70115-0009.htm_para3"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Curry"--><a name="07011513000331"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="594"-->There are huge questions to be addressed. Milton Keynes gives us a limited amount of information. There is a single landlord in Milton Keynes. It is difficult to extrapolate from that example to a more generally applicable case. There is a huge difference between development on brownfield and greenfield sites—and there is a huge range of brownfield sites, not just a single example—and between a small scale project and a major project, as the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich said.<a name="stpa_o112"></a><a name="70115-0009.htm_para4"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Curry"--><a name="07011513000332"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="594"-->The point at which the tax takes effect is important. How differentiated will the tax be? We need some idea of the rates and the differentials, and at what point the uplift is realised. How will the Government's 30 per cent. be used? As the right hon. Gentleman said, developers will get busy minimising the tax. Finding ways of not paying the tax will not be a cottage industry—it will be a metropolitan industry. Tax avoidance is a perfectly legitimate and honourable activity. I have just received a significant bill from the Treasury, which is due on 31 January. I am actively engaged in finding out whether there are any nooks and corners of tax avoidance that I have not yet managed to identify. I regret to say that I have failed, and the cheque will be on its way at the last possible moment consistent with not being fined.<br><meta name="Date" content="15 Jan 2007"><notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_595"></a><br><a name="stpa_o113"></a><a name="70115-0009.htm_para5"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Curry"--><a name="07011513000333"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="595"-->These issues are crucial. The tax is not radical. It is a whimper, not a bang, of a tax. The problem is that the inconvenience that the whimper will cause is out of all proportion to the benefit that the tax might yield. That is the heart of the problem. The tax will not pay for Crossrail. The south-east is the region where the tax has its greatest value, as it were. Given the differential yield that it is likely to raise regionally, will the Government build into it revenue support grant formula assumptions about the level of tax yield and therefore use it as a form of redistribution, particularly as the idea of the return of the business rate seems to be a lost aspiration, as far as the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe and I are concerned?<a name="stpa_o114"></a><a name="70115-0009.htm_para6"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Curry"--><a name="07011513000334"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="595"-->The proposed tax is not a “with one bound Jack was free” sort of tax, and it will not be flush with money. If anyone has fantasies that it will take the strain off council tax and eventually bail us all out of the council tax dilemmas, the sooner they return to reality, the sadder but wiser they will be. The tax will certainly not get the Government off the hook of the non-return of the business rate. In other words, it is thin gruel.<a name="stpa_o115"></a><a name="70115-0009.htm_para7"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Curry"--><a name="07011513000335"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="595"-->Finally, there is the question of the timing. I understand that the intention was to introduce the tax in April 2008. Even that could be difficult to achieve, which moves us towards the more political dates to which the minds of those in the House are inescapably drawn. That is why a little part of me says that the tax may never come into existence.<a name="stpa_o116"></a><a name="70115-0009.htm_para8"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Curry"--><a name="07011513000336"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="595"-->On the option mentioned by the spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable), the land value tax, I am aware that there is a significant volume of academic opinion that is strongly supportive. Both Sam Brittan and Martin Wolf of the<i> Financial Times</i> have spoken in favour of it. If one wants to push people into development, one chooses that mechanism. The mechanism has been used in some cities in the United States, which provide examples of what can happen. However, the sociology of the United States is very different from the sociology of the United Kingdom, and the political disadvantages would be significant.<a name="stpa_o117"></a><a name="70115-0009.htm_para9"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Curry"--><a name="07011513000337"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="595"-->I know that we always choose widows and orphans when we want to make a particularly heart-rending point, but I return to the example of a widow who has lived in the same house all her life. She may be asset rich, but she is cash poor. There is a paddock in which her grandchildren play and in which her children used to play, but it has been incorporated in the development line of the local district council. The site valuer comes along and says, “That land must be pushed into development,” which is the last thing that she wants to do. I can imagine the political flak that that would generate.<a name="stpa_o118"></a><a name="70115-0009.htm_para10"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Curry"--><a name="07011513000338"></a>

That is not what we are discussing today, but it is difficult to know what we are discussing today on the basis of the Bill.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="596"-->The panel was setting out the future shape and development of our area for the 10 years from the date when the plan was published—it took us several years to formulate the plan. Our biggest task was to decide which large tracts of land to allocate to accommodate new houses. The figure for the number of new houses, which seemed rather high, was handed down to us by central Government, who were Conservative at the time. To listen to Conservative Members today, one would think that previous Tory Governments never did such a thing as hand down the number of houses to be built. As the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon has said, it is the responsibility of every Government to ensure an adequate supply of housing, which is why this Government launched the Barker review.<a name="stpa_o121"></a><a name="70115-0009.htm_para13"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Bob Blizzard"--><a name="07011536000019"></a>

The low-value agricultural land was turned into highly valuable sites as we raised our hands in committee to allocate them—it has been said today that such decisions can multiply the value of land by a factor of 250 or 300. Back then, it seemed wrong to me that the communities that we represented got nothing out of that increase, especially in view of the huge sums involved. I cheekily asked the planning officers whether we could invite the owners of suitable fields to bid for the allocations, because we had plenty of fields to choose from—of course, the answer was no.<a name="stpa_o122"></a><a name="70115-0009.htm_para14"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Bob Blizzard"--><a name="07011536000020"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="596"-->Through development briefs, which were facilitated by section 106 agreements, we required the developers to provide open space and play areas to contribute to community facilities and to provide some affordable housing. However, I felt that that was a meagre return compared with the huge uplift in the value of the land and the lucrative prices that the houses fetched once they were built. Nothing that can be achieved through section 106 agreements addressed the fundamental transport infrastructure weakness in our town. Therefore, when Kate Barker proposed the planning gain supplement in her review of the housing market and its economics, I instinctively thought that she was right and that my instincts all those years ago had been right.<br><meta name="Date" content="15 Jan 2007"><notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_597"></a><br><a name="stpa_o123"></a><a name="70115-0009.htm_para15"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Bob Blizzard"--><a name="07011536000021"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="597"-->Throughout the years when I sat on planning committees, we tried to make the best use of section 106 agreements, but they involved protracted and complex negotiations. Planning officers often told us that what we wanted was outside the scope of a 106 or that it was not linked closely enough to the development, even though the community wanted it desperately. Sometimes the developers refused and went to appeal, or they called our bluff and we had to give in.<a name="stpa_o124"></a><a name="70115-0009.htm_para16"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Bob Blizzard"--><a name="07011536000022"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="597"-->I acknowledge that there have been improvements in the operation of section 106 agreements since 1997 but, as noted in the recent DCLG publication, “Changes to Planning Obligations”, they have several key problems and deficiencies. We have already heard about the variations in application by different local authorities, the lack of certainty for developers, the lack of transparency, the delays, and the inevitable accusations, particularly from the public, of the buying and selling of planning permission.<a name="stpa_o125"></a><a name="70115-0009.htm_para17"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Bob Blizzard"--><a name="07011536000023"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="597"-->I welcome the concept of the planning gain supplement and will follow its development with interest. Yes, some things have failed in the past, but the world moves on. We must be fair to communities which need to gain from development. Many people do not want large new housing developments. Some of them are nimbys who live on the edge of town and cherish their views and their closeness to the open countryside but forget that when their homes were built they took away other people's views and sense of space. Others make a much more valid objection to large housing developments when they say, rightly, that the constant expansion of a town places more pressure on the community's basic infrastructure, particularly transport.<a name="stpa_o126"></a><a name="70115-0009.htm_para18"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Bob Blizzard"--><a name="07011536000024"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="597"-->Nowhere is that better illustrated than in the town of Lowestoft, which I live in and represent. Our town is cut in two by a river. It is not a real river; it is more an inlet that was cut through from Oulton broad to the sea in Victorian times. There is only one bridge in the town over that waterway, which we call Lake Loathing. It is a lift-up or bascule bridge to let the ships into the inner harbour of our port. The only other way of getting across the waterway is by the bridge at Oulton broad about 2 miles down the road. In Victorian times, the bascule bridge was sufficient to serve the town, but it has expanded somewhat since then, and the bridge has become a bit like the constriction between the two bulbs of an hourglass, which continue to grow while the constriction remains the same.<a name="stpa_o127"></a><a name="70115-0009.htm_para19"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Bob Blizzard"--><a name="07011536000025"></a>

We have long held the aspiration and hope that our salvation would come from something that we call the third crossing—another bridge across the waterway to relieve the strain on the bascule bridge. We have never been able to achieve that through section 106 agreements, and I do not think that we will able to do so in future. To understand what it is like living in the town—a lovely town, but with that problem—one need only imagine London with half its bridges taken away, which would make it quite difficult to get around.<br><meta name="Date" content="15 Jan 2007"><notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_598"></a><br><a name="stpa_o128"></a><a name="70115-0009.htm_para20"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Bob Blizzard"--><a name="07011536000026"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="598"-->The bridge is part of the A12 trunk road system but it is difficult to get Government money for it. It was a preferred route in the early 1990s but the previous Government abandoned it. Since 1997, we have got a southern relief road to it from the south and a northern spine road that will connect to it in the north, but we still do not have the bridge. Our problem is that it is not on the way to anywhere—it is simply in the middle of Lowestoft.<a name="stpa_o129"></a><a name="70115-0009.htm_para21"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Bob Blizzard"--><a name="07011536000027"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="598"-->The Government recently established an urban regeneration company called 1st East to regenerate the town. My hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning is familiar with it and we thank her for her good sense in agreeing to setting it up. It commissioned a recent study, which showed that, if we are to regenerate our town, the third crossing is essential.<a name="stpa_o130"></a><a name="70115-0009.htm_para22"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Bob Blizzard"--><a name="07011536000028"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="598"-->The subject is relevant to the PGS debate because the situation has got worse over several decades as the town expanded. As that has happened, more money has gone to landowners but none of the money or the development gain has gone into what our town needs most—the third crossing. If only a few hundred pounds had been put into a kitty for every house that had been built in Lowestoft in the past couple of decades, we would have a great pot of money, which could contribute to what we need.<a name="stpa_o131"></a><a name="70115-0009.htm_para23"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Bob Blizzard"--><a name="07011536000029"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="598"-->The reason that I am prepared to run with PGS, give it a go and see what happens is that it could make a huge difference to the future of the development of Lowestoft. Many more homes have come on stream, and further development will take place as a result of the urban regeneration company. All that development could make a huge contribution to our third crossing through a PGS. That would not fund the whole project—we would still need to approach the Department for Transport—but it would make the benefit-cost ratio figure look better and increase  the likelihood of funding. I therefore say, “Bring it on”, because the community, not only those who happen to own the land, can gain from it.<a name="stpa_o132"></a><a name="70115-0009.htm_para24"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Bob Blizzard"--><a name="07011536000030"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="598"-->It has been said that PGS could stifle development. Clearly, there is a limit to what such a supplement could raise, but there is still room for it. On the plan panel, we allocated one of the pieces of land back because we believed that we could get an important road out of it. We all believed that we would get a dual carriageway but, when the plan was presented, it was for a single carriageway. By then, I was a Member of Parliament and had left the local plan panel behind. I told the developer that I believed that we were going to get a dual carriageway. He replied, “You could have got the dual carriageway. It would have meant that the landowner got less money but ultimately the county council asked me for only a single carriageway.” It is clear that more scope exists for getting something out of development.<a name="stpa_o133"></a><a name="70115-0009.htm_para25"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Bob Blizzard"--><a name="07011536000031"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="598"-->The details need to be worked out for another Bill but I am heartened by the consultations that we have held so far.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="599"-->but there is no proof whatever that that will occur. I do not take their assertion on trust. I am not prepared just to give the PGS a go and see what happens. That would be a recipe for disaster for many of our communities. We have heard about good and bad section 106 practices—indeed, we just heard about some particularly bad section 106 negotiations. However, I do not argue that we should not get tougher in negotiations or that we should throw those negotiations out of the window.<a name="stpa_o141"></a><a name="70115-0009.htm_para33"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Anne Main"--><a name="07011536000040"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="599"-->Having been the chair of a planning committee, I would argue that the one positive thing about section 106 agreements, in all their imperfect forms, is that they are directly linked to discussions and communications with the community that is suffering the harm of the development. If planning committees play hardball with developers, they can make the system work. Much of the time I find myself nodding in complete agreement with the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford)—the system can be made to work really well.<a name="stpa_o142"></a><a name="70115-0010.htm_para0"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Anne Main"--><a name="07011536000041"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="599"-->The trouble with the Bill is that it represents the biggest divorce of cause and effect that could possibly be imagined. The developer will happily hand over a percentage, because that will be a done deal for him. He will know exactly what he has to do in the system, but the local authority will not know all the vagaries of what on earth it will get back or what it can deliver. What is more, the people who have voted in the local<br><meta name="Date" content="15 Jan 2007"><notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_600"></a><br>authority that might have had some say on the planning decision will have absolutely no way of coming back at their local council when the hoped-for goods are not delivered. The PGS is therefore the worst of all possible scenarios. With a straightforward tax for the developer—easy come, easy go—he will not need to negotiate with or even talk to the community that might suffer the harm. All that will happen is that he will get on with his developments and the local community will be left bewildered as to exactly how much it can expect to receive in return.<a name="stpa_o143"></a><a name="70115-0010.htm_para1"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Anne Main"--><a name="07011536000042"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="600"-->I am afraid that I was not assured—again, I am such an old cynic—by the words “area” or “authority”. Altering the structure of the authorities will mean a wholly different beast, but again we are not sure about areas, such as for hospital provision. I am not due to receive a hospital in my area—that one has been scotched—but there is one in Watford. I should also like to correct the hon. Member for Twickenham  (Dr. Cable)—Watford is not my constituency. One could argue that, because my constituents go to that area, they are receiving some benefit from a hospital or facility placed elsewhere; but they do not want it there, they want it in their own area.<a name="stpa_o144"></a><a name="70115-0010.htm_para2"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Anne Main"--><a name="07011536000043"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="600"-->It has been argued that payments under section 106 arrangements were made willingly, because they were win-win. I support that. I do not think that the fact that some people did a bad job and got a single and not a dual carriageway is a reason for abolishing section 106.<a name="stpa_o145"></a><a name="70115-0010.htm_para3"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Anne Main"--><a name="07011536000044"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="600"-->The PGS is a redistributive tax—it has no other form—because, although we are not sure of the figures, at least 30 per cent. will be redistributed. The local community that has suffered the harm will have no say in that. In communities such as mine, with large areas of green belt and greenfield sites, which are protected, there will be a perverse incentive to redesignate those areas, because they will have the biggest planning gain uplift. In areas with lots of brownfield sites, which might have almost a negative value before remedial works are done, local authorities might be pressured into releasing more green belt land and green fields, as they scrabble around to ensure that they secure the funding, in order to deliver their share of an area's contribution, particularly if there is an assessment formula. We should therefore consider the proposals incredibly carefully.<a name="stpa_o146"></a><a name="70115-0010.htm_para4"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Anne Main"--><a name="07011536000045"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="600"-->Then there is the law of unintended consequences. We have not really heard about the valuations. Mention has been made of self-assessment—and, therefore, people perhaps laying themselves open to investigation if they get the assessment wrong—but there was not much clarity in the response to my question about who in the community can really challenge those assessments. Again, the arrangement becomes a done deal between the developer and the Government with which everybody else can either agree or disagree.<a name="stpa_o147"></a><a name="70115-0010.htm_para5"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Anne Main"--><a name="07011536000046"></a>

He said that he welcomed the fact that the Government had accepted many of our recommendations, but there were a few that they did not accept, one of which concerned the comparison between section 106 agreements and the planning gain supplement. The Committee had some quite heated<br><meta name="Date" content="15 Jan 2007"><notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_601"></a><br>debates about that.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="601"-->we thought that that meant the public and the voters as much as anybody else.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="601"-->and that comparing potential section 106 revenue and the planning gain revenue was considered to be disproportionately difficult and expensive. A local area will therefore never know whether it was better off under 106 or planning gain supplement. The Committee felt that local areas and local people should be able to see that, so I am disappointed that we are being asked to accept the PGS on a hope value and expect things to be better. I am not prepared to give it a go, to suck it and see, or to do whatever else we are supposed to do, licking and promising all over the place. [Hon.

We have not heard at what point that chain of accountability for the planning gain supplement will stop. That will make proposals hugely convoluted, with people arguing about the exact proportion for which they are liable, as they hand on planning consents through the system.

Hon. Members on the Government Benches might put me right on this, but I defy them to show me how the paper trail could be followed back to the person who originally bought land that was sold on and on, on hope value rather than planning permission.

I come to the debate from two different perspectives: first, from that of our debate in the Environmental Audit Committee two years ago; the hon. Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois) also served on that Committee. The issue in that debate was how, whatever investment is made in the south-east, we should make sure that we build sustainable communities. It is important that we consider environmental impact assessments and how they relate to infrastructure.<a name="stpa_o156"></a><a name="70115-0010.htm_para14"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Joan Walley"--><a name="07011536000058"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="602"-->My other starting point, which makes it so important for me to speak in this debate, is our situation in north Staffordshire. Many of the contributions so far have been about development in the south-east and how to get infrastructure there; my concern is about north Staffordshire, an area in need of great regeneration. Ministers know all too well about our problems there. I place my contribution in the context of the two issues that I have mentioned.<a name="stpa_o157"></a><a name="70115-0010.htm_para15"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Joan Walley"--><a name="07011536000059"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="602"-->From the outset, I should say that I wholeheartedly support the principle of developers contributing to infrastructure and community facilities. It is important that we do not think that “one size fits all” on this issue. We should consider how we can get the right kind of investment to different parts of England—and Scotland and Wales as well—and back it up with the different means of raising it that are required.<a name="stpa_o158"></a><a name="70115-0010.htm_para16"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Joan Walley"--><a name="07011536000060"></a>

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="603"-->I also want to flag up constituents' concerns. Even before we consider how the new tax might work, I would like the Minister to take one step backwards and consider the existing housing legislation relating to the compensation paid to people when their homes are acquired for the purposes of housing market renewal. Such people find themselves unable, even with the extra support through section 106 and other means, to get like for like. Perhaps they very much want to carry on living in the community of the housing market renewal, and want to be there in five and 10 years' time. However, they will get insufficient compensation to buy the kind of house that they had before in the area to which they are attached.<a name="stpa_o164"></a><a name="70115-0010.htm_para22"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Joan Walley"--><a name="07011536000066"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="603"-->I urge the Minister for Housing and Planning to consider our cases studies in north Staffordshire. We are talking about a tax on land at the stage when it has an uplift and about the profits that developers are making. Rightly, we want those to go into improved infrastructure. However, I am also concerned about home owners who will not be involved in the profits from the sale of the property, so the development will<br><meta name="Date" content="15 Jan 2007"><notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_604"></a><br>be at their expense unless we find a way of pulling those issues together.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="604"-->Practitioners too have expressed concerns to me. I have concerns about the fact that we have a paving Bill without knowing any of the constraints under which we are to operate. I should like us to look beyond the south-east to brownfield sites such as those I that described in Stoke-on-Trent. I urge that in pre-legislative scrutiny, we consider all the details of the issues that I am flagging up now.<a name="stpa_o166"></a><a name="70115-0010.htm_para24"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Joan Walley"--><a name="07011536000068"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="604"-->In the first instance, the Government have suggested that under the new system, infrastructure falling outside the narrower scope of planning obligations will be delivered through other public sector funding mechanisms. However, I am still not clear about how that system will provide the confidence that pathfinder areas will have. A high priority is needed for infrastructure funding. As we work out the area research and master planning, it is already clear that although the urban core of north Staffordshire has already established how much infrastructure investment is needed and the economic and social contexts, there will have to be huge investment.<a name="stpa_o167"></a><a name="70115-0010.htm_para25"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Joan Walley"--><a name="07011536000069"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="604"-->It is difficult to see where the parallel investment in the environment and public realm will come from. For example, the latest criteria for assessing bids to the transport innovation fund are unhelpful to us in north Staffordshire, because there is no obvious source for investment in housing, in the city centre and in new jobs and facilities. I want the Government to consider how their national departmental functions can be wholly aligned and supportive of the sustainable communities programme so that we can match the new housing investment with that needed for new education and all the other things required.<a name="stpa_o168"></a><a name="70115-0010.htm_para26"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Joan Walley"--><a name="07011536000070"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="604"-->It would be helpful to have assurances on the Government's commitment to the alignment of infrastructure funding gathered through the supplement. I hope that it can be linked with other mechanisms to support substantial infrastructure investment underpinning north Staffordshire's pathfinder programme, along with related investments in the city centre, key employment sites and an education centre. The provisions for the review referred to in the “Changes to Planning Obligations” consultation paper seem to refer only to financial provision for investment in growth areas, but the pathfinder areas are just as important as the growth areas. I hope that when the Minister is developing her thinking on PSG, she will not distinguish between growth areas and pathfinders; otherwise the PSG will be seen as merely another form of very centralised tax gathering for the Treasury, with no benefits for the regeneration and market renewal investments that my constituency needs so badly.<a name="stpa_o169"></a><a name="70115-0010.htm_para27"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Joan Walley"--><a name="07011536000071"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="604"-->Earlier speakers mentioned affordable housing contributions. The proposal for a clear legal and policy basis for them is welcome, but the proposal for a common starting point, using the value of the site for a dwelling as a basis for negotiating affordable housing contributions, could cause difficulties. I hope that my hon.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="604"-->I should like to say a little about the way in which the consultation paper dealt with—or perhaps did not deal with—planning methodologies. Substantial change is already taking place, and we need to catch up with  the whole local development framework. Planning<br><meta name="Date" content="15 Jan 2007"><notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_605"></a><br>inspectors are making decisions about planning applications, and there is real concern that they may not be in line with the framework.<a name="stpa_o171"></a><a name="70115-0010.htm_para29"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Joan Walley"--><a name="07011536000073"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="605"-->There are also issues relating to regional spatial strategy, the local planning authority and the planning inspectorate, which have already been drawn to the attention of Lady Andrews, the housing Minister in the other place, in the context of the new planning policy statement 3. It would be useful to have an assurance that PPS3 will give weight to the housing market renewal programme in the assessment and development of statutory planning policy at regional and local level, and in the determination of planning applications. My discussions with the housing Minister in the other place lead me to hope that she will visit Stoke-on-Trent and north Staffordshire in the not too distant future, which might provide an opportunity for those discussions to be taken further.<a name="stpa_o172"></a><a name="70115-0010.htm_para30"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Joan Walley"--><a name="07011536000074"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="605"-->This may not be the right time or the right place for me to say what I am going to say, but there never is a right time and a right place. I remind my hon. Friend that part of our housing market renewal programme is closely linked to desperately needed economic regeneration. One of the targets that we have set ourselves is try to relocate a Government agency from the south-east to Stoke-on-Trent, so that we can provide jobs for those who will build the new houses that are needed in north Staffordshire's housing pathfinder area.<a name="stpa_o173"></a><a name="70115-0010.htm_para31"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Joan Walley"--><a name="07011536000075"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="605"-->When my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary introduced this paving Bill, he spoke of the dedicated team in the unit that would collect the tax and provide a valuation service. Has any thought been given to where it will be based? Could that be put in the context of the Lyons review and the Office of Government Commerce? Perhaps north Staffordshire could be considered as a location for some of the unit's paving work, given that resources are available.<a name="stpa_o174"></a><a name="70115-0010.htm_para32"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Joan Walley"--><a name="07022026000001"></a>

Friend the Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois), is merely the leading option of many, and has yet to be enshrined in substantive legislation. The Financial Secretary gave us a number of pointers and teasing suggestions about what might be included in a subsequent substantive Bill, but he referred several times to the conditionality of the Bill, using the “if”<br><meta name="Date" content="15 Jan 2007"><notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_606"></a><br>word. I have heard of floating ideas through the media, but now they are being floated through Parliament. We are here this evening to throw money at the issue—not inconsiderable amounts of money. In answer to a question, the Financial Secretary said that we were talking about £40 million. I note from the explanatory notes that we are actually being asked to approve expenditure of £52 million on we know not what, at this stage.<a name="stpa_o176"></a><a name="70115-0011.htm_para1"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Philip Dunne"--><a name="07011536000078"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="606"-->I have had the pleasure of being involved in some pre-legislative scrutiny, which I think is an extraordinarily good idea, but asking the House for pre-legislative expenditure strikes me as a dangerous precedent.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="606"-->I should like the Minister to give some idea of the running costs that we can expect for the additional branch of Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, and how they would interrelate with any savings that might be found in planning departments of local authorities if a large part of the function of negotiating agreements with developers and planners were subsumed in HMRC. I share with my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) the privilege of serving on the Public Accounts Committee, and there has been remarkably little resemblance between actual and budgeted expenditure on any information technology project that we have examined since I have been a member of the PAC. I sincerely hope that if the Bill is passed, HMRC and the Treasury will be called to account and required to show the Committee what it ends up spending rather than what it planned to spend.<a name="stpa_o178"></a><a name="70115-0011.htm_para3"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Philip Dunne"--><a name="07011536000080"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="606"-->Let me deal with some of the wider issues raised by the Bill. In his 2005 pre-Budget report, the Chancellor described the planning gain supplement as “a local tax for local people”. We have heard very little about “localisation” in today's debate. What we have heard is that it will be the Treasury that takes control of not only the calculation of the tax—which will be taken away from local people—but the collection of it, and the distribution of a large proportion of the receipts. The tax may be paid by local people, to the extent that local developers and landowners will be paying, but it will be determined by the Treasury—the clunking centralised fist of the present Chancellor and his successors.<a name="stpa_o179"></a><a name="70115-0011.htm_para4"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Philip Dunne"--><a name="07011536000081"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="606"-->The Financial Secretary gave us a glimpse of how much might be left to local people when he referred to 70 per cent. of receipts reverting to the local authority area. That raised considerable concerns on the Opposition Benches, and among the Labour Members who were brave enough to express them. I would like to know—perhaps the Minister can shed more light on this in her winding up—who will determine where that 30 per cent. that will be taken from the local community will go. Will it be the Treasury, or the regional government office? It was denied earlier that it will be the regional assembly, which is good news in a way, but who will it be, if not either of those parties?<a name="stpa_o180"></a><a name="70115-0011.htm_para5"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Philip Dunne"--><a name="07011536000082"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="606"-->I remind Members that we were given one other clue: we were told that receipts would be ring-fenced within national boundaries. So the region—or, rather, the nation—of Scotland will retain its 30 per cent. I took<br><meta name="Date" content="15 Jan 2007"><notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_607"></a><br>that to mean that England will, perhaps, be lucky enough to retain its 30 per cent. but if it is intended that there will be a lower level of regional allocation, that would be useful to know. We have heard that adjacent regions might have a call on that 30 per cent. That is not the right way to proceed; the areas that will suffer from the blight of the development should receive the financial benefit.<a name="st_o195"></a><a name="07011536000083"></a>

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="607"-->The other area that caused me concern was the use of the word “area”. It was clear that we were talking not about the local authority but about the local authority area. In my county of Shropshire—I am pleased to see that the hon. Member for Telford (David Wright) has returned to his place—we are in the midst of a debate on whether we should move from a two-tier structure to a unitary structure. The word “area” currently has connotations of a unitary area. Therefore, in Shropshire, which is a large county, funds raised from my constituency could be spent 50 miles away in the hon. Gentleman's constituency, or further north, in north Shropshire. As far as my constituents are concerned, that is not the local area.<a name="stpa_o182"></a><a name="70115-0011.htm_para7"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Dunne"--><a name="07011536000086"></a>

Protection of the rural environment—greenfield sites—is an issue in Shropshire. Does he agree that if infrastructure spending can be transferred to a place such as Telford—or, indeed, the fringe of the west midlands—we can protect green space in rural areas better? If we facilitate development in towns and the west midlands conurbation, that is better than taking sites in south Shropshire out of green use.<a name="st_o198"></a><a name="07011536000088"></a>

However, if rural areas suffer development and generate revenue for the wider good, funding resulting from that should largely be spent in the area where the development has taken place, not remotely, many miles away or in a different area, which I think is the intent behind the 30 per cent. funding going centrally for distribution on a basis that we know not, at this point.<a name="stpa_o183"></a><a name="70115-0011.htm_para8"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Dunne"--><a name="07011536000089"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="607"-->I was about to address a source of revenue for local authorities that they would lose under the proposals. At present, section 106 agreements can give rise not only to some community gain in development terms,<br><meta name="Date" content="15 Jan 2007"><notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_608"></a><br>but to substantial funds that local authorities can use to spend according to their own priorities, which might or might not be directly related to a planning issue—or alternative planning issues, such as building a car park or more affordable housing. That is one of the few sources of discretionary revenue available to many smaller councils. It would be difficult for those councils if they were to lose that revenue source as a result of the introduction of planning gain supplement.<a name="stpa_o184"></a><a name="70115-0011.htm_para9"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Dunne"--><a name="07011536000090"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="608"-->Let me turn to the scope of the proposed planning gain charge. There has been much comment in the various Government consultations on how it should take effect. We heard from the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Joan Walley)—whom I am pleased to follow—that many aspects remain opaque at best. She called on her Front-Bench colleagues to pursue discussions with interested parties to try to define the scope of the tax clearly so as to prevent a number of anomalies from arising.<a name="stpa_o185"></a><a name="70115-0011.htm_para10"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Dunne"--><a name="07011536000091"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="608"-->I was pleased that the Financial Secretary said that home improvements would be excluded from the tax. I was also interested when he said that the tax would apply to small-scale residential developments. I am concerned that it also appears that it would apply to affordable housing. If that is the case, land brought forward for affordable housing would become more expensive, which might restrict the supply of affordable housing, particularly in rural areas where schemes might be small or for single plots, and therefore be developed on their own, not in conjunction with larger market housing schemes. I urge the Government to consider in detail the rural-proofing aspects of the tax when drawing up any eventual Bill.<a name="stpa_o186"></a><a name="70115-0011.htm_para11"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Dunne"--><a name="07011536000092"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="608"-->We currently face challenges in our rural economy in trying to encourage farm diversification and appropriate environmental improvements in rural areas. It would be a great shame if they were put at risk or jeopardised by an ill-thought-through planning tax that could, for example, affect the construction of waste slurries on an agricultural holding, which would suddenly require planning consent, or affect such things as flood defences or waste energy plants.<a name="stpa_o187"></a><a name="70115-0011.htm_para12"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Dunne"--><a name="07011536000093"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="608"-->We have heard plenty of historical examples, nicely encapsulated by the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford), of the fact that a lot of effort goes into finding ways around land tax surcharges. That has been the history of all five of the previous schemes introduced, as has been rehearsed this evening. My principal concern about any such tax that the Minister seeks to introduce is that it is highly likely to reduce the amount of land brought forward for development, rather than to increase it. That has been the history of previous attempts, and I fear that it would be the history of this one. The reduction of the supply of land will have the inevitable consequence of increasing the cost of available land, in contrast to the Government's arguments in response to the consultations. Therefore, it will have the consequence of increasing house prices.<a name="stpa_o188"></a><a name="70115-0011.htm_para13"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Dunne"--><a name="07011536000094"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="608"-->I shall now briefly turn to the section 106 scheme now in operation across the country. It has a number of acknowledged difficulties, but it has worked relatively well. In my area it works well in delivering affordable housing and other planning gain to the community. My concern is that if it is to remain, how are we to avoid the ramifications of a double taxation system? If local<br><meta name="Date" content="15 Jan 2007"><notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_609"></a><br>authorities can still impose section 106 agreements for community benefit and we also have a planning gain supplement of whatever percentage the Government choose, we run the risk of driving development out of an area because of excessive demands on the developer and the elimination of profit, which drives development in most cases.<a name="stpa_o189"></a><a name="70115-0011.htm_para14"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Dunne"--><a name="07011536000095"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="609"-->If planning authorities continue to levy a section 106 agreement and retain 100 per cent. of the cash contribution—if that is the manner in which the charge is made—there will be little incentive for them to do anything other than secure as high a section 106 agreement charge as they possibly can, rather than charging a planning gain supplement, at least 30 per cent. of which they could lose. The interaction between those two charges could lead to some very perverse consequences. The Government need to establish a clear explanation of, and division between, how those two charges will work.<a name="stpa_o190"></a><a name="70115-0011.htm_para15"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Dunne"--><a name="07011536000096"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="609"-->Another question is how the levy will be paid and at what point. I am thinking in particular of greenfield land, which is subject to a long development lead time, but the same is true of some brownfield land. There is a significant brownfield site in my constituency that the local regional development agency is hoping to contract to purchase. It has been under-exploited since manufacturing ceased a couple of decades ago, and it has been a blight on the edge of Bridgnorth. Such land deals take a long time to negotiate and are normally done by means of an option rather than a direct contract, and an option is not a contract. If the charge is to be levied at the point at which the gain takes place, that might well be many years after the contract has been signed—when the land is developed and the property eventually built on it is sold to an investor. At what point will the charge come in, and which party will bear the charge? All these things need thinking through very carefully to ensure equity in the process, and to ensure that whoever secures the gain also endures the pain.<a name="stpa_o191"></a><a name="70115-0011.htm_para16"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Dunne"--><a name="07011536000097"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="609"-->Finally, I want to give an example of a development tax in operation in my constituency. It applies to residential developments as small as single dwellings, and was introduced by South Shropshire district council only three months ago, at the beginning of October. The Liberal Democrat-controlled council introduced a tax of 50 per cent. of build cost, and in line with its calculations, it has charged £60,000 per dwelling. The tax was introduced following a moratorium on open market house building on single plots for anything other than affordable housing. Demand has increased in my constituency, given the severe shortage of housing in the area. The House will not be surprised to hear that despite that pent-up demand, there has not exactly been a flood of applicants to pay this considerable tax. In fact, there has been only one application for a single plot since this magnificent policy was introduced. Of course there has not been a flood of applicants, because this is an excessive tax, not a reasonable one.<a name="stpa_o192"></a><a name="70115-0011.htm_para17"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Dunne"--><a name="07011536000098"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="609"-->That example illustrates well to the Minister the importance of proportionality. As a number of Labour Members have said, the tax must be introduced at such a level that it will not restrict yet further the amount of available land for development. It must be seen to be a reasonable tax that is bearable to pay, in view of the<br><meta name="Date" content="15 Jan 2007"><notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_610"></a><br>gains that have been received. In my view that is the best way to ensure that if the tax is eventually introduced, it will not reduce supply and drive up  costs.<a name="ordayhd_10"></a><a name="70115-0011.htm_ordayhd0"></a><a name="07011536000737"></a>XZXZomit desc="time"YWYW6.33 pmXZXZ/omitYWYW<a name="st_o199"></a><a name="07011536000099"></a>

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="610"-->I should declare an interest as a county councillor for Northamptonshire, a county that is heavily involved in the sustainable communities project. Let me give the House an idea of what that project will mean to my county. By 2023, an additional 100,000 houses will have been built there and, by 2031, a further 67,000 will have been built. That could increase the population of Northamptonshire, which stands at some 630,000, by 50 per cent. In other words, it could increase by between 300,000 and 360,000.<a name="stpa_o194"></a><a name="70115-0011.htm_para19"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Brian Binley"--><a name="07011536000101"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="610"-->The House will appreciate that such a population uplift will place a tremendous demand on the infrastructure and mean that the county will require a further 1,100 hospital beds. By 2031, we will also require an additional 20 upper schools and 60 primary schools. That is to say little of roads or of improving what is a not very good rail transport situation, particularly so far as the connections to London and Birmingham are concerned. It is fair and proper to say that they have improved of late under this Government, but the fact remains that we are talking about a loop away from the main line that will not be able to service the proposed population increases. We already know that there will be a service provision shortfall of some £715 million over the next 16 years. I hope that the House is getting the impression that we face some serious problems and that we need some serious help.<a name="stpa_o195"></a><a name="70115-0011.htm_para20"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Brian Binley"--><a name="07011536000102"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="610"-->I turn to the Green Paper that has been pointed out to me in no uncertain terms by Labour Members. Incorrectly, we are relying massively on this little Green Paper and the increase in planning gain that it will bring to the people of Northamptonshire. The belief is that there will be a planning gain of between £40,000 and £60,000 per house. It does not take a rocket scientist to work out that, at say £40,000 per house, building 40 houses per hectare will bring in a tax of £1.6 million. Crudely speaking, that is the approximate current price of a hectare of land for development in Northamptonshire. The urban development corporation believes that it might bring in £1.6 million per hectare, and that there will not be an increase in land prices. However, I cannot imagine anybody with any sense simply giving the land to the corporation, so we are left with a conundrum. There is no way in God's heaven that the money raised by the planning gain supplement will come anywhere near meeting the cost of the infrastructure that the county will require to support the 50 per cent. increase in population.<br><meta name="Date" content="15 Jan 2007"><notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_611"></a><br><a name="st_o200"></a><a name="07011536000103"></a>

Gentleman knows more about what will go on behind the Bill than the rest of the House does. We are told that 30 per cent. of the planning gain supplement will be handled by the Government in one form or another. However, we are not told what it will really be used for, how much it will cost to collect or how many civil servants will be needed to administer it. Most of all, we are not given any guarantee that the infrastructure needed to support the increase in population will be forthcoming from the Government.<a name="stpa_o196"></a><a name="70115-0011.htm_para21"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Binley"--><a name="07011536000105"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="611"-->A good argument has been made to the effect that people will not sell land at that level of planning gain taxation, so there will be a dearth of land on which to put those 167,000 homes. That point was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne). The increased population will be forced on us by a Government who refuse to guarantee us the infrastructure required to support it. Therein lies the concern. We have asked again and again for guarantees from the Government of money to ensure that the infrastructure will be in place by the time that those people settle in our county. The Government have consistently refused to give us that guarantee. They want the people of Northamptonshire to accept the extra housing on the basis of a vague undertaking that the taxation will be in place, much of it through this Bill, to supply the necessary infrastructure. We have seen many Government promises over the past 10 years. They do not fill us with confidence.<a name="stpa_o197"></a><a name="70115-0011.htm_para22"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Binley"--><a name="07011536000106"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="611"-->I do not wish to understate the confidence that I place in the Minister who will wind up the debate. We are fortunate that she is in her position and have had considerable help from her in the past. However, the Government's record on keeping promises has been abysmal and the people of Northamptonshire recognise that. Our fear is that we will be let down again. We will have the houses dumped on us, but we will not have the infrastructure to support the new arrivals.<a name="stpa_o198"></a><a name="70115-0011.htm_para23"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Binley"--><a name="07011536000107"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="611"-->I have several questions to which I hope the Minister can reply when she winds up. First, how much does she think should be raised by a planning gain supplement? Unless we know that and can relate it to the number of houses to be built, we have no idea how far the supplement will go towards paying for infrastructure or how much the Government will need to add. Secondly, we want to know whether the Government will guarantee the money for the required infrastructure to the people of Northamptonshire, so that they can proceed with some confidence. At present, they sorely lack that confidence.<a name="stpa_o199"></a><a name="70115-0011.htm_para24"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Binley"--><a name="07011536000108"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="611"-->Thirdly, will the retained element be used to supply the infrastructure for sustainable communities projects? If so, we need to see the figures, because I suspect that the money to be raised will come nowhere<br><meta name="Date" content="15 Jan 2007"><notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_612"></a><br>near the money that is needed. If the money does not come from the planning gain, where will it come from in general taxation?<a name="stpa_o200"></a><a name="70115-0011.htm_para25"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Binley"--><a name="07011536000109"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="612"-->Finally, what greenfield sites will be built on to raise the money necessary to provide the planning gain that will answer all the problems with infrastructure? I realise that that is not part of the purpose of the Bill, but it is a vital question. At the moment, in Northampton, we are talking about building 22 houses on brownfield sites, but they will not provide the planning gain taxation necessary, not least because of the cost involved in reclaiming the sites to make them fit for building on.<a name="stpa_o201"></a><a name="70115-0011.htm_para26"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Binley"--><a name="07011536000110"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="612"-->The Bill fails to answer all those questions and does not give the people of Northamptonshire any confidence. I see smiles on the faces of Labour Members, clearly much cleverer than I am, who do not share my fears. I invite them to come to Northamptonshire and answer the questions I have asked. I would be delighted if they did so—it would help me and the people of Northamptonshire enormously. There is a challenge for you.

Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry), who likewise has tremendous expertise.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="612"-->The intrinsic difficulty with today's debate is that, although it has ranged widely, its foundation has been very narrow: a Bill with only three clauses. A central difficulty has been that, although we know the general drift of the Government's position, or at least we thought that we did, there is little detail to go on. Although the Bill—this exercise in pre-legislative<br><meta name="Date" content="15 Jan 2007"><notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_613"></a><br>legislation, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack) called it—is contested and controversial, the debate has demonstrated widespread agreement on several important points, as the hon. Member for Waveney (Mr. Blizzard) pointed out. There is agreement that parts of the planning system are, as the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister once put it,<a name="70115-0012.htm_brev0"></a><a name="07011536000703"></a><ul><p class="tabletext">“opaque, slow, unfair, complex and reactive”.</ul><a name="stpa_o204"></a><a name="70115-0012.htm_para1"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Paul Goodman"--><a name="07011536000116"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="613"-->There is agreement that developers should meet planning obligations that are necessary, relevant to planning and directly related to proposed developments in scale and kind and there is agreement that section 106 agreements are in need of reform—a point on which the right hon. Gentleman offered some ideas.<a name="stpa_o205"></a><a name="70115-0012.htm_para2"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Paul Goodman"--><a name="07011536000117"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="613"-->There is essentially agreement about many of the ends, but it cannot be emphasised strongly enough that what we are voting on tonight is not an end, but a means—namely, this Bill. As we all know, it is a paving Bill, which presages a further Bill, the contents of which are still a matter for consultation—indeed, for a second round of consultation, as announced in the pre-Budget report, following the first round of consultation that was announced in the pre-Budget report of 2005 and finished last February.<a name="stpa_o206"></a><a name="70115-0012.htm_para3"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Paul Goodman"--><a name="07011536000118"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="613"-->The House is familiar—arguably, increasingly familiar—with paving Bills. I note in passing that the past paving Bill that the Library note maintains is the most similar to the present paving Bill is the Tax Credits (Initial Expenditure) Bill—not a happy precedent in any way. The House is familiar with paving Bills, but it may not be so familiar with paving Bills that presage Bills that are still the subject of formal consultation. We would be grateful to know—we are rather curious on this side of House—whether the Minister will, in her reply tonight, furnish the House with some precedents.<a name="stpa_o207"></a><a name="70115-0012.htm_para4"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Paul Goodman"--><a name="07011536000119"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="613"-->In short, we do not yet know what the Bill that may follow this Bill will look like. Indeed, we cannot be absolutely certain, especially after the Financial Secretary's opening speech, whether there will be a Bill at all. He referred specifically to the “potential” introduction of a Bill and saw the introduction of any planning gain supplement as a “lead option”. It is all far from certain, and that fact alone should give the House considerable pause for thought before we vote tonight to permit expenditure in excess of £50 million—no small sum—on project staff in the Valuation Office Agency and, of course, the Treasury, as well as a related IT system. As my hon. Friend the Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois) said, IT projects are notoriously difficult to introduce on budget, as those of us with any knowledge of scrutinising the performance of the Child Support Agency's computer difficulties could confirm.<a name="stpa_o208"></a><a name="70115-0012.htm_para5"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Paul Goodman"--><a name="07011536000120"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="613"-->Although we cannot be certain what any planning gain supplement Bill will look like, the House can be reasonably clear about the drift of the Chancellor's thinking. His favoured means of raising some additional revenue—either, on an uncharitable view of his motives, to reduce the £167 billion that he plans to borrow over the next five years or, on a more charitable view, to tackle the planning problems that the House has heard about this evening—is essentially to introduce a development land tax. It will first be<br><meta name="Date" content="15 Jan 2007"><notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_614"></a><br>centrally collected by the Treasury, which may—we are still not clear about it—take a slice of the proceeds, and it will then be recycled by the Treasury in part to the regions, which will take a slice of those proceeds. Only a part of this tax revenue will therefore be returned to the local authorities in which the developments that were taxed in the first place were sited, and even that arrangement is not written into the text of the Bill.<a name="stpa_o209"></a><a name="70115-0012.htm_para6"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Paul Goodman"--><a name="07011536000121"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="614"-->I have to say on behalf of Conservative Members—I assume that it is the same for the Liberal Democrats—that we are not taking any of the Government's guarantees seriously before we see the fine print of an actual Bill. The fact is that guarantees are not written into this Bill, which raises in turn the question of how whatever money is not grabbed first by the Treasury and then by the regions will be returned to local authorities. The Select Committee on Communities and Local Government has raised the possibility of the remaining money being filtered through a “funding formula”, which presumably means—if we eventually see an actual Bill—the deployment of the full panoply of top-slicing, floors, ceilings and resource equalisation criteria that have made the shift from the standard spending assessment to the formula spending share such a model of clarity and transparency during recent years.<a name="stpa_o210"></a><a name="70115-0012.htm_para7"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Paul Goodman"--><a name="07011536000122"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="614"-->Now the Chancellor may believe—indeed, he evidently does—that such a centrally collected and organised land development tax, the tax that may be presaged in the Bill, should be acceptable to this House. By contrast, we believe that such a tax, and therefore the Bill, should not be acceptable to this House, for four reasons additional to the one I have already given—namely, that the Bill is a wholly insufficient preparation for a second Bill that may or may not arrive.<a name="stpa_o211"></a><a name="70115-0012.htm_para8"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Paul Goodman"--><a name="07011536000123"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="614"-->First, we believe that planning system problems will not be solved by a centrally collected tax that may be top-sliced first by the Treasury and then will be top-sliced by the regions before any money finds its way back to local authorities.<a name="stpa_o212"></a><a name="70115-0012.htm_para9"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Paul Goodman"--><a name="07011536000124"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="614"-->Secondly, we believe that planning system problems will not be solved by a regionally administered tax that may give more powers to unelected, unaccountable and discredited regional bodies. When my hon. Friend the Member for Rayleigh mentioned that possibility earlier, the Financial Secretary was quick to his feet to say that it had not been specifically mentioned in respect of the Government, but when my hon. Friend challenged him further, he did not rule out the possibility. At the moment, we simply do not know. It is just one of the elements of vagueness in the Government's proposals that leads us to oppose the Bill tonight.<a name="stpa_o213"></a><a name="70115-0012.htm_para10"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Paul Goodman"--><a name="07011536000125"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="614"-->Thirdly, we believe that, since the Chancellor has not yet announced the rate at which the new tax will be set—the subject of much of this evening's debate—the House cannot be sure that it will be set high enough to raise enough revenue for infrastructure while remaining low enough not to deter developers from building affordable housing in particular. That is admittedly a difficulty with any proposal, but I say again that we are being asked to vote tonight on a Bill when we do not know the level at which the Government will set the tax.<br><meta name="Date" content="15 Jan 2007"><notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_615"></a><br><a name="stpa_o214"></a><a name="70115-0012.htm_para11"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Paul Goodman"--><a name="07011536000126"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="615"-->Fourthly, we believe—and the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich made something of the point—that development land taxes have a chequered history. The Library brief cites the development charge, which was introduced in 1947 and scrapped in 1952; the betterment levy, which was introduced in 1967 and scrapped in 1970; and the development land tax itself, which was introduced in 1976 and eventually scrapped in 1986. It is striking that each of those taxes—let us not be over-distracted by the use of the word “levy” or “charge” or, in the case of the Bill, “supplement”—was introduced by a Labour Government, who were succeeded at the subsequent election by a Conservative Government. It is also striking that each of those taxes was introduced at a time when the tide of public opinion was turning against the Labour Government in question.<a name="stpa_o215"></a><a name="70115-0012.htm_para12"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Paul Goodman"--><a name="07011536000127"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="615"-->It is also significant that the Chancellor is repeating the approach of his predecessors. There is the same reliance on control and command from Westminster and Whitehall and on micro-management from the Treasury and taxation from the centre. This Bill is a revealing precursor of what is to come when the Chancellor, after his long wait of more than 12 years, finally makes it to No. 10. This Bill, and any planning gain supplement, will meet the same end as its predecessors: if introduced in the form we expect, it will be overturned by the next Conservative Government. I urge the House to reject the Bill tonight.<a name="ordayhd_12"></a><a name="70115-0012.htm_ordayhd1"></a><a name="07011536000739"></a>XZXZomit desc="time"YWYW6.58 pmXZXZ/omitYWYW<a name="st_o205"></a><a name="07011536000128"></a>

It is important that local areas meet their housing planning numbers—something that the south-east and the Conservative-led South East England regional assembly oppose. They are arguing for cuts to the overall level of housing development. I would be intrigued to know which camp he counts himself in. Is it the Surrey Heath camp, the metropolitans who are charging across the countryside shooting at nightjars and concreting over farmers' fields, or the Meriden camp, the bananas brigade, who oppose building new homes wherever that is happening? He will be reassured to know that, whichever camp he chooses, he will find that the right hon.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="617"-->This is a paving Bill. My hon. Friend the Financial Secretary made it clear that we have not taken final decisions or made final announcements. Further work and consultation is under way. If it continues to be deemed workable and effective, we will introduce a planning gain supplement. There have been other such paving Bills, including, in addition to the one raised by the hon. Member for Wycombe, the British Coal and British Rail (Transfer Proposals) Act 1993 and section 137 of the Finance Act 2002, which gave authorisation for preparations for a lorry road-user charge Bill. We have not taken decisions, but we are clear on the principles that are involved. We need more houses across the country and we need more infrastructure.<a name="stpa_o222"></a><a name="70115-0012.htm_para19"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Yvette Cooper"--><a name="07011536000137"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="617"-->We also believe that it is possible to raise additional resources from planning gain without deterring development. There are considerable increases in land value that are created by the planning system. The planning system is a vital part of our community and development framework in this country. It safeguards us from urban sprawl and from inappropriate development, but it also creates value and wealth. It is right that a proportion of that wealth should be used to support the local community and the infrastructure that makes the development possible in the first place. It is important to ensure that those extra resources are raised in a way that is sustainable and supports development, rather than hinders it. That is why we have said that the PGS would be at a modest rate. The advantages of a PGS is that it is proportionate to the planning gain, so if there were no gain through the planning system, no PGS would be paid. That is the reassurance for those who are dealing with sites requiring remediation, for example. We have set out in the consultation on valuation how that issue should be addressed.<a name="stpa_o223"></a><a name="70115-0012.htm_para20"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Yvette Cooper"--><a name="07011536000138"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="617"-->A PGS would also apply to a much wider range of sites. It is difficult to apply section 106 to small sites without creating burdens for local authorities or developers. We should recognise that the evidence shows that only 40 per cent. of major residential planning permissions included a section 106 agreement. That means that 60 per cent. of major housing developments had no section 106 agreement in place at all. For the smaller sites, 90 per cent. had no affordable housing or infrastructure contribution included. That is a problem. If we can find a way to raise additional resources from the planning gain to put into the infrastructure, there will be a huge advantage, not just for housing growth areas, but for housing renewal areas and areas across the country.<a name="st_o208"></a><a name="07011536000139"></a>

He will know that different local authorities have different arrangements in their plans, which specify different kinds of thresholds. The major residential planning permissions were as described in the Sheffield research, which was conducted some time ago. That described major residential planning permissions as those with more than 10 houses. We have to recognise that that means that smaller developments were<br><meta name="Date" content="15 Jan 2007"><notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_618"></a><br>unlikely to have section 106 agreements. It is difficult to have individually negotiated settlements on small sites. That will obviously mean additional pressures for local authorities, but also for developers. That is the advantage of a planning gain supplement approach: it allows us to have a system that can be applied to smaller sites and can raise additional revenue from smaller sites.<a name="stpa_o224"></a><a name="70115-0012.htm_para21"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Yvette Cooper"--><a name="07011536000141"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="618"-->There are considerable merits in the optional planning charges approach, the tariffs and the expanded section 106. We support the tariff in Milton Keynes and other growth areas. However, there are some questions about how widely that can be applied to other areas that are not growth areas and do not see substantial levels of housing being built on similar sites. There are serious questions about how realistic some of the alternatives that other people have proposed are.<a name="stpa_o225"></a><a name="70115-0012.htm_para22"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Yvette Cooper"--><a name="07011536000142"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="618"-->My right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich has made important points about the experience in his constituency. Certainly Greenwich has considerable expertise in relation to raising resources from section 106 agreements. It has lots of large sites and considerable potential for relative increases in land value. On individual sites, the resources that can be raised through an individual section 106 negotiation may well be higher than they would be through a planning gain supplement. However, the advantage of a planning gain supplement might be that it could be extended to a wider range of sites. Those are the sorts of trade-offs that need to be taken into account.<a name="stpa_o226"></a><a name="70115-0012.htm_para23"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Yvette Cooper"--><a name="07011536000143"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="618"-->We have received questions about valuations, which are being dealt with as part of the consultation that is under way. We need to recognise that, of course, some valuations will be more difficult than others, but those difficulties exist under the current system, when difficult and complex negotiations take place in relation to section 106 agreements.<a name="stpa_o227"></a><a name="70115-0012.htm_para24"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Yvette Cooper"--><a name="07011536000144"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="618"-->At least 70 per cent. of the funding would go back to the local authority. That gives local authorities considerable power and responsibility. In many ways, this is a devolutionary approach. It gives local authorities more flexibility to make decisions across their areas. They can consider the balance between an area where there is considerable infrastructure need, but little planning gain, and, on the other side of the town, an area where there may be limited infrastructure requirement, but considerable planning gain. That gives local authorities considerable flexibility to make their decisions about where they think resources from a planning gain supplement could best be raised.<a name="stpa_o228"></a><a name="70115-0012.htm_para25"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Yvette Cooper"--><a name="07011536000145"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="618"-->Opposition Members should reconsider before they decide to vote against the measure tonight. It is a paving Bill. It is a sensible Bill. They need to consider their opposition to this whole approach—to building more homes and to building more infrastructure. They say that they want more infrastructure, but they must get serious about how it is funded so that the homes that we need are delivered. We cannot deliver the homes that the next generation will need without additional infrastructure funding, and their approach simply is not good enough.<a name="stpa_o229"></a><a name="70115-0012.htm_para26"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Yvette Cooper"--><a name="07011536000146"></a>

The hon. Member for Meriden has simply said that her party is drawing up exciting alternatives. We wait for those with bated breath, because the Conservatives are saying not only that they would refuse to support a planning gain supplement, but that they would cut public sector investment in infrastructure to reduce the proportion of public spending in the economy. They do not want the money to come from the taxpayer or from development gain. They must tell us where they want it to come from, because we need additional investment for infrastructure and for the homes that we need for the future.<a name="stpa_o230"></a><a name="70115-0012.htm_para27"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Yvette Cooper"--><a name="07011536000147"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="619"-->We have set out a series of consultations on ways in which we want to raise money for the infrastructure for the future.

For the sake of the next generation, which needs the new homes and this infrastructure, the Conservatives should support the Bill.<a name="stpa_o231"></a><a name="70115-0012.htm_para28"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Yvette Cooper"--><a name="07011536000148"></a>

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="626"-->In reply to our letters urging the Government to try to find a way of tackling the problem of helicopter noise, the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, the hon.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="626"-->We were provided with contact details for the British Helicopter Advisory Board, but it appears that existing bodies do not take responsibility for the environmental impact of helicopters that fly across our communities, and certainly not for the noise that they create.<a name="stpa_o250"></a><a name="70115-0013.htm_para18"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Susan Kramer"--><a name="07011536000656"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="626"-->I very much welcome the investigation into these issues that was published by the Greater London authority last October, entitled “London in a spin—a review of helicopter noise”. The Minister met members of the GLA and staff who produced it to try to begin to develop a response. We are delighted that she did so, and my role tonight is to engage in a pincer movement, and keep up the pressure to secure action to deal with an increasing annoyance.<a name="stpa_o251"></a><a name="70115-0013.htm_para19"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Susan Kramer"--><a name="07011536000657"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="626"-->I would love to tell the House the number of helicopter movements across London, but there is no comprehensive database that keeps count of such movements. Battersea heliport, which is the main heliport in London, has planning permission for 12,000 commercial movements a year, but police, air ambulance and military helicopter movements are not included. The GLA estimates that about 13,000 flights were made to and from Battersea heliport in 2006. There were 11,000 flights in 2003, so the trajectory is for a significant increase every year. The Civil Aviation Authority produces data on helicopter take-offs and<br><meta name="Date" content="15 Jan 2007"><notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_627"></a><br>landings, but it does not include flights into or across London from airfields around the capital such as Biggin Hill, Denham and Fairoaks.<a name="stpa_o252"></a><a name="70115-0013.htm_para20"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Susan Kramer"--><a name="07011536000658"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="627"-->The pattern of flights is particularly annoying. We suspect that corporate entertainment is a major cause of aircraft movements, as there are clusters of flights during events such as Ascot and the Farnborough air show, causing disruption for several days. National Air Traffic Services does not keep data on low-level traffic over London, as it focuses on safety and does not think that it should keep track of movements. The British Helicopter Advisory Board, which the Government recommended we contact to achieve action on the problem, does not collect data at all. Each organisation seems to regard the others as data-collecting agents, and they disagree about increases in flights and who is responsible for those flights. As the GLA was forced to conclude, there is no joined-up collection or monitoring of data.<a name="stpa_o253"></a><a name="70115-0013.htm_para21"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Susan Kramer"--><a name="07011536000659"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="627"-->There is a lack of standards, too. There is an attitude in government that anything that business wants in aviation it gets, regardless of the impact on the community. My constituency suffers significantly from noise from Heathrow, and my residents believe that the Government's approach to aviation is one of predict and provide, particularly in the expansion of that airport. There are genuine fears that many more helicopter movements will be permitted in future. There is no incentive to reduce helicopter noise, because there are not any regulations to encourage the use of newer, quieter helicopters. Many fleets are  30 years old and have little new technology, so they continue to disturb people.<a name="stpa_o254"></a><a name="70115-0013.htm_para22"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Susan Kramer"--><a name="07011536000660"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="627"-->When we raised the issue of expansion and additional helicopter movements across the city, we were told that business needs those things. That argument is always made about anything to do with aviation but, interestingly, my hon. Friend the Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) told me that when he entered the House, there were several helipads in his constituency, including one by the Oxo tower in the middle of the river and one at Chambers Wharf. The argument was repeatedly made that it would harm business in London if those heliports were closed. Following pressure, public inquiries and general activity, they were indeed closed, and the economy of London and Southwark did not collapse. Many spurious arguments are made to justify the constant expansion of helicopter capacity which, it is claimed, is necessary for the survival of London as an economic centre.<a name="stpa_o255"></a><a name="70115-0013.htm_para23"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Susan Kramer"--><a name="07011536000661"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="627"-->New proposals have been made for increased helicopter capacity in east London, perhaps at City airport, and many people believe that we have a growing helicopter culture. Regional Airports Ltd has told the GLA that it wants to be able to shuttle people to and from the London Olympics by helicopter from Biggin Hill. There is a great fear that that practice would set a precedent for regular shuttles to the City.<a name="stpa_o256"></a><a name="70115-0013.htm_para24"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Susan Kramer"--><a name="07011536000662"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="627"-->Residents are disturbed by helicopter noise, but it is hard to determine that objectively, because there are not any standards by which to measure it. In testimony to the GLA, Phil Roberts of the CAA is reported to have said that data on the human response to helicopter noise are limited, so it is difficult to define an<br><meta name="Date" content="15 Jan 2007"><notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_628"></a><br>objective measure. We have managed to find methods of measuring noise from fixed-wing aircraft, and I urge the Minister to make progress on defining a standard for helicopters. It is important, however, that we do not repeat a key mistake in the measurement of fixed-wing aircraft noise, which determines average noise. No one ever hears average noise—people are disturbed by individual events. If the Minister concedes that point, and helps us to make progress on a standard for helicopter noise, I believe that we will not import the problem of averaging, which makes it almost impossible for residents to engage in a reasonable discussion about aircraft noise with the Government, BAA and other parts of the aviation industry.<a name="stpa_o257"></a><a name="70115-0013.htm_para25"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Susan Kramer"--><a name="07011536000663"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="628"-->There are concerns, too, about consultation, the history of which is not a happy one. In 2004, when the CAA reduced the minimum altitude for helicopter flights over London from 1,500 ft to 1,000 ft, it conducted an extensive consultation. The only problem was that all the consultees were from the aviation industry. We must start to consider residents and to understand that they have a vested interest in a good environment for the city. That means that they must be listened to on issues such as noise.<a name="stpa_o258"></a><a name="70115-0013.htm_para26"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Susan Kramer"--><a name="07011536000664"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="628"-->The designated route in the London control zone is essentially the route of the Thames, although the police and ambulances obviously have greater freedom. What enforcement is there of that route? The comments that I quoted earlier reflect a great deal of helicopter activity around Barnes, which is a holding point. It is also where there is a loop in the Thames. As a resident, I frequently see helicopters abandon the route and start to take what they think is a clever short cut, which takes them across the Wetlands centre—the largest urban waterfowl sanctuary in Europe—as well as disturbing people under the flight path.<a name="stpa_o259"></a><a name="70115-0013.htm_para27"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Susan Kramer"--><a name="07011536000665"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="628"-->As I was coming into the Chamber for the debate, I was approached by various colleagues. Apparently, there have been three complaints recently from Kingston and Surbiton about helicopter noise. What helicopters have been doing in that area, disturbing residents, is beyond me. My hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Lynne Featherstone) constantly receives reports of helicopter noise over Hampstead heath and experiences it directly over her own house, so she is conscious that that traffic is increasing and increasingly disruptive. The GLA received many reports from residents in Greenwich and the Isle of Dogs, so the problem is widespread over London. Anywhere that the Thames happens to wander, there seems to be a helicopter noise problem. The Thames is at the heart of this city, so the impact is not just in one or two isolated places.<a name="stpa_o260"></a><a name="70115-0014.htm_para0"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Susan Kramer"--><a name="07011536000666"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="628"-->The International Civil Aviation Organisation recommended an altitude of 1,000 ft across Europe as a consistent measure. However, that is not at all appropriate for London. The French ignore the rule altogether for Paris, because they do not want Parisians or tourists to be disturbed. It is time that we started to find ways to ignore that standard for London. I have spoken to people in the industry, and some concern has been expressed that the reason why the UK has not resisted the 1,000 ft minimum altitude is that it wishes to protect the higher airspace for increasing numbers of<br><meta name="Date" content="15 Jan 2007"><notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_629"></a><br>fixed-wing flights. That underscores the fundamental problem with aircraft and helicopter noise of all sorts in this city.<a name="stpa_o261"></a><a name="70115-0014.htm_para1"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Susan Kramer"--><a name="07011536000667"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="629"-->What practical steps can residents take in order to avoid living in a zone disturbed by helicopters? There is no way to find a noise map to see where the problem is. Even if people decide to try to avoid the problem, there is nothing that they can do. If they want to make a complaint, what do they do? Increasingly, members of the public are turning to their Members of Parliament, but it is exceedingly difficult to work out whether a specific type of complaint should go to the Department, the CAA, National Air Traffic Services or the airport operator. There is very much a “Not my job, guv” attitude towards such flights.<a name="stpa_o262"></a><a name="70115-0014.htm_para2"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Susan Kramer"--><a name="07011536000668"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="629"-->Where do we go from here? I broadly support the GLA recommendations, and I am sure that the Minister is familiar with those. We need a proper review of noise and a comprehensive data collection and monitoring mechanism. Residents need a clear and simple way to complain and to get answers. We must have proper consultation procedures. I strongly support the proposal for a heliport consultative committee. There should be such a committee for Battersea, as there is at airports.<a name="stpa_o263"></a><a name="70115-0014.htm_para3"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Susan Kramer"--><a name="07011536000669"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="629"-->In some ways I would go further than the GLA report. That mentions the annoyance caused by media and advertising flights. Nobody can claim that those are central to London's economy. I would like to see them banned, given the volume of other users. There are suggestions that helicopter capacity could be increased at City airport and other places. There may be better locations for a heliport than Battersea. If Battersea residents could express their opinion on that, they would no doubt think it was a delightful suggestion. If there is new capacity, it must be instead of, not in addition to, Battersea, which is the threat that we think we face.<a name="stpa_o264"></a><a name="70115-0014.htm_para4"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Susan Kramer"--><a name="07011536000670"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="629"-->I hope that the Minister will give a commitment tonight that the issue will be taken seriously. Noise pollution, especially from the air, is an increasing blight over one of the finest capital cities in the world—the finest, I would argue. Residents should not have to suffer from such disturbance. Other than police, military and ambulance movements, we are dealing with a luxury service which serves a small number of people while disturbing a very significant number. I look forward to the Minister's reply.<a name="ordayhd_15"></a><a name="70115-0014.htm_ordayhd0"></a><a name="07011536000742"></a>XZXZomit desc="time"YWYW7.45 pmXZXZ/omitYWYW<a name="st_o216"></a><a name="07011536000671"></a>

No doubt Mr. Sikorsky was somewhat biased in his view, but there is no doubt that the helicopter's ability to land and take off in relatively congested areas is a great benefit to many, making the helicopter a key mode of transport in many circumstances.<br><meta name="Date" content="15 Jan 2007"><notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_630"></a><br><a name="stpa_o266"></a><a name="70115-0014.htm_para6"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Gillian Merron"--><a name="07011536000673"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="630"-->In particular, the helicopter is a key tool in emergency and military situations. We know how many lives have been saved, perhaps in our own areas, by air ambulances. There was substantial media interest recently in the role of the Yorkshire air ambulance following the crash involving the “Top Gear” presenter Richard Hammond last year. This led to a campaign to raise funds for the Yorkshire air ambulance charity. To date some £200,000 has been pledged as part of that campaign, showing that the public appreciate the positive role that helicopters can play.<a name="st_o217"></a><a name="07011536000674"></a>

That number has never been acknowledged before as involving police and ambulance helicopters.<a name="st_o218"></a><a name="07011536000675"></a>

Helicopters are a feature of life today and we cannot wish them away. To some extent they could be seen as a sign of the successful economy that the Government have delivered. Of course we must ensure that there is safety for those in the air and those on the ground. That is our first priority, and I am proud of the UK's record in this regard.<a name="stpa_o268"></a><a name="70115-0014.htm_para8"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Gillian Merron"--><a name="07011536000677"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="630"-->Clearly, helicopters have a particular local environmental impact through the noise that they make. It was therefore timely and welcome for the Greater London assembly environment committee to look into the issue of helicopter noise, and its report, for which the Department for Transport provided evidence, gives valuable food for thought. I was pleased to hold a constructive and productive meeting with members of the environment committee to discuss their findings. I will comment later on the action that we agreed to take forward, but first I shall clarify a few points.<a name="stpa_o269"></a><a name="70115-0014.htm_para9"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Gillian Merron"--><a name="07011536000678"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="630"-->The hon. Lady suggested, erroneously, that the Government's policy on aviation was to predict and provide. The fact is that the issue is not all about predict and provide; it is about balance, economic development, the environment and the interests of local communities. The progress report on the air transport White Paper has been well received in all quarters—by “quarters”, I mean stakeholders all across the country rather than, as has been suggested, only those involved in the aviation industry.<a name="stpa_o270"></a><a name="70115-0014.htm_para10"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Gillian Merron"--><a name="07011536000679"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="630"-->The hon. Lady has referred to the so-called reduction to 1,000 ft in the height at which helicopters can fly. That was done in 2005, and was based on the need for improved aviation safety, which is paramount.<a name="stpa_o271"></a><a name="70115-0014.htm_para11"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Gillian Merron"--><a name="07011536000680"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="630"-->I reassure the hon. Lady and her constituents that we take the measurement of aircraft noise seriously. We take account of the operational noise made by aircraft in setting noise objectives, and we are very conscious of its impact on local communities. My Department has a<br><meta name="Date" content="15 Jan 2007"><notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_631"></a><br>broad role on overall helicopter noise policy, but it is not involved in overseeing or approving helicopter operations. There are, of course, regulations under civil aviation legislation governing flight by helicopters over London, which are the Rules of the Air Regulations 1996 and the Air Navigation (Restriction of Flying) (Specified Area) Regulations 2005.<a name="stpa_o272"></a><a name="70115-0014.htm_para12"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Gillian Merron"--><a name="07011536000681"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="631"-->The rules of the air stipulate that, except where there is CAA permission in writing, no craft shall fly below a height of 1,000 ft over congested areas. The specified area regulations require that helicopters do not fly over central London below a height that might present a potential safety risk in the event of a power unit failure. For single-engine helicopters, that includes the use of specified routes and prohibition from the central London area, because of the requirement to be able to alight safely in the event of power unit failure. The helicopter routes have been designed to maximise safety by avoiding built-up areas as much as possible, and to minimise environmental impact. It is important to point out that twin-engine helicopters have the potential to maintain height and to continue flight in the event of one engine failing, and so can be authorised to fly other than on the designated routes, providing that that is in accordance with the rules of the air.<a name="st_o219"></a><a name="07011536000682"></a>

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="631"-->On compliance with the regulations, all helicopter flights in the controlled air space over London are subject to an air traffic control clearance, and single-engine helicopters flying routes are subject to particular visibility minima. Air traffic controllers monitor compliance with air traffic control clearances and instructions, while the CAA, which is responsible for the enforcement of aviation legislation in the UK, will investigate any reported breaches and take enforcement action as necessary.<a name="stpa_o274"></a><a name="70115-0014.htm_para14"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Gillian Merron"--><a name="07011536000685"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="631"-->Police helicopter activity is governed by the provisions of the police operators certificate, which exempts the police from certain parts of the rules of the air regulations.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="631"-->The hon. Lady asked about complaints from the public, and referred to complaints by her constituents. The Department for Transport receives a number of complaints about the noise arising from helicopter operations, especially in the summer months. In responding, I can comment on the Government's overall policy, as I have just outlined, but we do not<br><meta name="Date" content="15 Jan 2007"><notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_632"></a><br>oversee day-to-day operations. Complaints are also received by the CAA. As the hon. Lady will know, however, there is no central complaints database. If the problem is a long-term one and the owner and/or operator of the helicopter is known, complainants may be referred to the British Helicopter Advisory Board, which has helpfully produced a number of documents. Those documents are available on its website, and they provide assistance to members of the community.<a name="stpa_o276"></a><a name="70115-0014.htm_para16"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Gillian Merron"--><a name="07011536000687"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="632"-->Complaints thought to be about police helicopters are matters for the relevant police air support or helicopter unit. One of the areas highlighted by the GLA environment committee, with which I have great sympathy, is that there could be a clearer complaints procedure for members of the public. The Department will work with interested parties to seek to deliver a more straightforward process. Local authorities can also play their part by helping their residents understand how to raise concerns. I intend us to work to help to alleviate the frustration experienced by the hon.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="632"-->Improved technology means that helicopters are less noisy than they were, and we seek reductions in noise at source by encouraging industry developments in aircraft and engine technology. The noise signature of helicopters does indeed differ from fixed-wing aircraft in that the noise derives not only from the engines but from the main and tail rotors, particularly from their tips. Therefore, silencing an engine alone will do little to improve the level of disturbance.<a name="stpa_o278"></a><a name="70115-0014.htm_para18"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Gillian Merron"--><a name="07011536000689"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="632"-->Since 1 August 1986, all new and modified versions of existing designs of helicopters to be flown in this country have been required to meet noise certification standards. The current requirements for helicopters are laid out in the Air Navigation (Noise Certification) Order 1990 and are based on the International Civil Aviation Organisation's annex 16. We in this country helped to establish, and have adopted, that international standard. However, where standards are concerned, further progress is dependent on international negotiation and agreement, which can then be implemented by the European Union and in national regulation. No significant technological advances are in prospect, but I assure the House that we will continue to seek reductions in source noise where possible, as we do for all aircraft. I should also say that most complaints that we receive relate to the unwanted presence of helicopters. It is rare for people to say that a slightly quieter helicopter would not bother them.<a name="stpa_o279"></a><a name="70115-0014.htm_para19"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Gillian Merron"--><a name="07011536000690"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="632"-->In December, I held a most constructive meeting with the Greater London assembly's environment committee. Its report made 14 recommendations, which I have studied, eight of which suggest action by the Department. However, committee members were realistic enough to recognise that it was important to identify key priorities, as I asked them to, so that our attention in the Department can be focused on the areas of most importance. One key priority that they identified was the need for a clearer complaints procedure. As I confirmed to the House, that is a point that we recognise and are taking forward.<a name="stpa_o280"></a><a name="70115-0014.htm_para20"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Gillian Merron"--><a name="07011536000691"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="632"-->The other key priority that we agreed was the need for better data.

I assure the House that the Department will work with the CAA and National Air Traffic Services to collect more comprehensive data, liaising as appropriate with the environment committee's officers. It is right to proceed in that way. Instead of launching a flurry of activity to try to address a problem the detail of which is not clear enough, we should first establish an understanding of the actual position and the trends.<br><meta name="Date" content="15 Jan 2007"><notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_634"></a><br>That will enable us to inform decisions on next steps.
