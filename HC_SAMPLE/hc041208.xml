My hon. Friend refers to claims handlers and others. In Wales, those others include the union NACODS—the National Association of Colliery Overmen, Deputies and Shotfirers—South Wales, which is led by a member of Plaid Cymru.

Indeed, I welcome the announcement today of Operation Reptile. My hon. Friend mentioned Operation Tarian, which came about as a result of the close collaboration between the Home Office, the Wales Office and the National Assembly. Operation Tarian is a police intelligence gathering unit whose aim is to prevent hard drugs from coming into Wales, and it is now in its second year of operation. In year one, 1.7 kg of heroin<br><br><a name="column_1151"></a><br><br>and cocaine were seized, representing assets worth about £1.7 million. So far this year, about 1 kg of heroin and cocaine have been seized, and 17 individuals have been convicted for supplying illegal drugs.

The Gracious Speech mentioned intervention, which obviously is good, but may I remind the Minister that there are fewer than 40 rehabilitation beds in the whole of Wales? Regrettably, many towns in Wales need 40 beds each. This is a mammoth task. Will the Minister redouble his efforts to ensure that this matter is properly resourced in Wales?<a name="st_o20"></a>

Indeed, he raised it at the Welsh Grand Committee yesterday as well. The drug intervention programme that was launched last year aims to get drug misuse offenders out of crime and into treatment, and the Home Office has made about £5 million available to the Assembly in Wales for that purpose. The Assembly has also launched its own tackling substance misuse partnership approach scheme, which has five modules: community prescribing, needle and syringe exchange, residential rehabilitation, in-patient detoxification and co-occurring mental health and substance misuse. All these measures are working together to tackle this matter, but I recognise that intervention must come as quickly as possible. It is so important to identify that window of opportunity when someone wants to kick their drug habit, so that the system can be there to get them off drugs and bring them the support they need.<a name="st_o21"></a>

They have created the substance misuse action fund, and substantially increased the amount of funding available from £3.3 million in 2002–03 to £18.5 million by 2007–08. That is an increase of 550 per cent. I regularly have meetings with the Assembly Minister responsible for social affairs, and I value and appreciate the interventions and programmes that the Assembly is progressing.

The position is clear. I shall be the departmental Minister for HMRC, and all Treasury Ministers have lead responsibility for specific matters.

I am talking about a major change in the way in which taxes and revenues are administered. This is not about shuffling a few Whitehall deckchairs, creating a new department and then assuming that the job is done. It is far more fundamental than that, as the Treasury Committee highlighted. I am talking about a process that goes beyond a simple merger of departments. It is a process of real integration, of bringing the two existing departments together and developing better new ways of working. It is about delivering truly joined-up services to taxpayers, and about creating an organisation that can meet taxpayersSSSQQQ needs because it can look across their affairs and tailor its services to their particular circumstances.<a name = "41208-05_para7"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dawn Primarolo"--><a name="stpa_6"></a>The question of meeting taxpayersSSSQQQ needs is a key one. That means that integration must mean different things in different parts of the business—another point touched on by the Treasury Select Committee—with parts of the business with very similar activities and remits merging in their entirety. For example, there are the corporate services; business areas with similar stakeholders or functions fully integrating their structures and activities—for example, the large business service—and other parts of the business that deal with a unique group of stakeholders not shared by other parts of HMRC connecting into the new Department structure. One example is some of the frontier protection work.<a name = "41208-05_para8"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dawn Primarolo"--><a name="stpa_7"></a>That sounds like a huge job and of course it is.

GentlemanSSSQQQs point about the continuation of services through the period of change.<a name = "41208-05_para12"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dawn Primarolo"--><a name="stpa_11"></a>Given the huge task, it is not particularly surprising that the Treasury Committee has suggested that further primary legislation is required fully to implement integration. Of course, as we the start the process of integration, I cannot confirm what will be needed, but<br><br><a name="column_1170"></a><br><br>I can say that we will be doing further work with David Varney, the prospective chairman of the new department, to look at how it should manage its business. If legislative change is needed to support our conclusions, it will be brought forward in an appropriate form for consideration by the House.<a name = "41208-05_para13"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dawn Primarolo"--><a name="stpa_12"></a>Delivering real, meaningful integration is a process that should be measured in years, not weeks. That has been acknowledged by all those who have commented on the Bill. It must be an ongoing process of continual improvement; a process that identifies and responds to taxpayersSSSQQQ needs, involving proper consultation where appropriate to produce robust and effective new policies. It must develop and exploit new technologies and working methods to create the integrated, coherent and consistent approach that we all seek, and that taxpayers rightly expect.<a name = "41208-05_para14"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dawn Primarolo"--><a name="stpa_13"></a>The Bill is, and can only be, the first step in that process, but it is a vital step. It creates the organisational structures within which the process of integration can develop. Without the Bill, that process of improving the way in which we deliver services to taxpayers cannot even start in the systematic way that we all want.<a name = "41208-05_para15"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dawn Primarolo"--><a name="stpa_14"></a>I shall explain briefly why integration is so important. The OSSSQQQDonnell review identified clear benefits from integration that will pay real dividends for people and businesses throughout the UK, and are vital to ensuring that this country remains a highly competitive place to do business. Foremost among those benefits are the improvements to taxpayer or customer focus that integration can deliver. The delivery of more joined-up services will result in a more consistent and coherent approach to taxpayersSSSQQQ affairs. Understanding taxpayers and taking a view across their affairs is essential to deliver a world-class service, built on support for taxpayers that is tailored to their needs.<a name = "41208-05_para16"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dawn Primarolo"--><a name="stpa_15"></a>We have already started identifying areas where this approach would be beneficial. The ChancellorSSSQQQs announcement at the pre-Budget report of a new small business unit at the heart of the new department is a key example. Improvements to the use of information within the new department should, as IT capability is developed, reduce the need for taxpayers to supply the same information several times over. The ChancellorSSSQQQs pre-Budget report announcement of work to develop ways of minimising the requirements on small businesses through, for example, a single tax return for all taxes and a reduction in the number of forms, is a key component of this agenda. Returning to the point made by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner), that will bring efficiency savings for business and Government alike.<a name = "41208-05_para17"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dawn Primarolo"--><a name="stpa_16"></a>The same developments that will improve the taxpayer experience will also improve the effectiveness of revenue administration, helping to reduce the tax gap. Better use of information, built around an ability to look across a taxpayerSSSQQQs affairs, will allow for more effective targeting of resources to areas of risk. That will improve fairness, making it harder for those who seek to avoid their obligations to succeed, and reducing unnecessary interventions in the affairs of honest taxpayers. There will also be efficiency improvements. Through economies of scale and alignment of common areas of activity, integration will produce efficiency savings of 3,200 posts by 2007–08.<br><br><a name="column_1171"></a><br><br><a name = "41208-05_para18"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dawn Primarolo"--><a name="stpa_17"></a>The Treasury CommitteeSSSQQQs report rightly suggested that a detailed analysis of the costs and benefits of integration would be helpful. The regulatory impact assessment published alongside the Bill sets out the costs and benefits of the legislation. Future substantive proposals for legislative reform will also be accompanied by regulatory impact assessments in the usual way, so that the costs and benefits of particular measures to effect integration can be considered. That further addresses the hon. GentlemanSSSQQQs point with regard to progress on integration over a period of time.<a name="st_9"></a>

If further costs are incurred, they will be identified in any subsequent regulatory impact assessment.

Members undoubtedly will be pleased to hear that I do not propose to describe the detail of each and every clause today—that pleasure awaits us in Committee—but I want to take a moment to outline the key measures that the Bill introduces. I confirm that we will table a number of Government amendments later. That is unfortunately inevitable, because those technical amendments involve cross-referencing right across the tax system. However, with the exception of a measure, which is currently being finalised, to provide information gateways for the new prosecutions office,<br><br><a name="column_1172"></a><br><br>those amendments will be minor or technical drafting amendments; the Bill before hon. Members today is, in essence, complete.<a name = "41208-06_para1"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dawn Primarolo"--><a name="stpa_19"></a>The Bill establishes HMRC as a non-ministerial department, led by commissioners acting under the general directions of Treasury Ministers. That armSSSQQQs-length relationship between Ministers and Revenue administration will maintain the existing convention that Ministers do not intervene in individual cases. The Bill transfers the statutory functions of the two existing departments to HMRC, and it provides for the manner in which the commissioners and their officers may exercise those functions. It also provides for the method of financing the costs of running HMRC, and creates a new framework for managing and accounting for the revenues, tax credits and other moneys that the department collects and pays out. That new framework includes measures to enhance parliamentary oversight of HMRCSSSQQQs finances; for example, it enhances existing arrangements for reporting daily revenue flows to the Comptroller and Auditor General.<a name = "41208-06_para2"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dawn Primarolo"--><a name="stpa_20"></a>The Bill introduces flexibility around the future functions of HMRC, putting it on a level footing with ministerial Departments to allow the transfer of functions into or out of HMRC by Order in Council.<a name="st_15"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1172"--><a name="41208-06_spnew6"></a><b> Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory  (Wells) (Con):</b><!--Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory--> The Paymaster General has just said that important functions could be transferred out. Those important powers could include intelligence gathering, enforcement and criminal prosecutions, and the transfer would simply be agreed by statutory instrument, which, as she knows, are seldom debated and not amendable. Does she think it right that important powers on enforcement and criminal prosecutions should be transferred in that way? Surely the point of the Bill is carefully to circumscribe and limit powers, so that Parliament knows in advance and in primary legislation who will exercise those powers, which should not exercised by Ministers as provided for in this Bill.<a name="st_16"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1172"--><a name="41208-06_spnew7"></a><b> Dawn Primarolo:</b><!--Dawn Primarolo--> If what the right hon. Gentleman, who was a distinguished Treasury Minister, suggests were true, I would agree with him, but the Bill introduces flexibility without compromising either the integrity of the tax system or the principle that administration of revenues is held at armSSSQQQs length from Ministers. The transfer from HMRC of taxes, duties, national insurance and tax credits work is not permitted under those arrangements, and the functions are the same as those of other departments. I assure the right hon. Gentleman that the Bill does not provide a gateway for transferring the responsibilities of the department without the proper scrutiny of the House.<a name="st_17"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1172"--><a name="41208-06_spnew8"></a><b> Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory:</b><!--Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory--> The Paymaster General has mentioned tax-gathering powers and tax credits, which will remain in the department, but I have mentioned other powers, such as intelligence gathering, prosecution and enforcement. She has not said whether there is a block on those powers being transferred. It would be different if those powers went from the new department, which will be headed by appointments by the Crown and<br><br><a name="column_1173"></a><br><br>therefore will be at one remove from Ministers, to Departments headed by individual Ministers. Will she give an assurance on those points?<a name="st_18"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1173"--><a name="41208-06_spnew9"></a><b> Dawn Primarolo:</b><!--Dawn Primarolo--> I want to be as clear as possible in giving the right hon. Gentleman an assurance on that point. I want to make it clear that all the departmentSSSQQQs current functions associated with tax and tax credits cannot be transferred under the Bill. The department could collaborate with a devolved Administration or undertake particular work—for example, the collection of student loans—on behalf of another department, but that does not include the administration associated with any of its revenue collection or protection duties.<a name = "41208-06_para3"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dawn Primarolo"--><a name="stpa_21"></a>That leads me on to the departmentSSSQQQs powers. The Bill is, as I have mentioned, the first step in an incremental process of integration. It does not introduce substantive changes to the administration of regimes, and existing powers for enforcing regimes therefore will be transferred to the new department without any change to the way in which or purposes for which they may be used. The Bill achieves that by ring-fencing powers to prevent their inadvertent extension within HMRC.<a name = "41208-06_para4"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dawn Primarolo"--><a name="stpa_22"></a>Let me spell out what that means in practice. I think that the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) will recognise this from the time when he was Economic Secretary. It means that a VAT inspector will retain all her current powers in HMRC, with no changes. Similarly, the powers of a corporation tax inspector in HMRC will remain as they currently are in the Inland Revenue. The Bill ensures that the VAT inspectorSSSQQQs powers do not become available to the corporation tax inspector, and vice versa. That applies across all HMRC functions. Powers in the new department remain as they currently are in the separate organisations.<a name = "41208-06_para5"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dawn Primarolo"--><a name="stpa_23"></a>This is, of course, only a temporary position. As the Treasury Committee report acknowledged, delivery of integration in the longer term on the scale that I described is likely to require greater consistency of approach to enable effective working across different taxes and duties. To that end, I can announce today that the Government will issue a consultation document in January that will consider the suitability of the existing range of powers, including the requirement to provide information; interest and surcharge regimes for late payment; penalties for non-compliance and rights of appeal; and the modern regulations and practices that HMRC will need to be a high-performing 21st-century tax administration.<a name = "41208-06_para6"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dawn Primarolo"--><a name="stpa_24"></a>The Government intend that following that initial consultation and the completion of the BillSSSQQQs passage, HMRC officials should enter into more detailed discussions with representative bodies. The consultation exercise does not aim to deliver reform in time for the creation of HMRC, but will be the beginning of a thorough review, with the aim of legislating where necessary in the 2006 Finance Bill.<a name = "41208-06_para7"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dawn Primarolo"--><a name="stpa_25"></a>In the meantime, to aid clarity on and public understanding of the powers available to HMRC for its different functions, an advice note on the powers available to officers of the new department will be published in time for the inception of HMRC. The<br><br><a name="column_1174"></a><br><br>Inland Revenue and Customs today placed a copy of the draft of that advice note on their internet site, seeking comments. It is also available in the Vote Office and the Library. The departments will also write to key representative customer and tax bodies to invite their comments.<a name = "41208-06_para8"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dawn Primarolo"--><a name="stpa_26"></a>This considered and incremental timetable for change has been welcomed by key representative taxpayer bodies, as well as by the Treasury Committee. I hope that the House, too, will endorse it.<a name = "41208-06_para9"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dawn Primarolo"--><a name="stpa_27"></a>The Bill confirms HMRCSSSQQQs authority to pool information internally so that information supplied for one of its functions can be used for any of its other functions. That authority is vital to deliver the joined-up services that the OSSSQQQDonnell review envisaged and to capture the consequent benefits in service and effectiveness. Again, that has been recognised by key external commentators as a necessary prerequisite for the successful integration of services.<a name = "41208-06_para10"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dawn Primarolo"--><a name="stpa_28"></a>I stress that HMRC will of course take taxpayer confidentiality every bit as seriously as the predecessor departments; the importance of that was recognised by the Treasury CommitteeSSSQQQs report. There will be no let-up in HMRCSSSQQQs commitment to safeguarding taxpayer confidentiality.<a name="st_19"></a>

That replaces the Inland Revenue oath, and for the first time extends it across former Customs and Excise matters, giving statutory backing to existing duties of confidentiality under employment contracts, across a larger range of functions. To reinforce that duty, the Bill provides for a criminal offence of unlawful disclosure of confidential information about an identifiable person by an HMRC officer. That extends the existing provision for Inland Revenue and Customs staff to all functions of the new department. The Bill replaces the existing authority for commissioners in either department to authorise disclosure of information with a much tighter provision that restricts them to authorising disclosures in prescribed, limited circumstances where there is a public interest case for doing so, as defined in regulations. Those regulations will be available for Members to see before the commencement of the BillSSSQQQs consideration in Committee.<a name = "41208-07_para1"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dawn Primarolo"--><a name="stpa_30"></a>The Treasury Committee identified the importance of maintaining taxpayer confidentiality where the Treasury and Ministers are concerned.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1174"--><a name="41208-07_spnew2"></a><b> Mr. John Burnett:</b><!--Mr. John Burnett--> May I take the Paymaster General back a paragraph or two to the streamlining of powers?

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1175"--><a name="41208-07_spnew3"></a><b> Dawn Primarolo:</b><!--Dawn Primarolo--> We need to consider whether powers are, for example, necessary, appropriate, proportionate, sanctioned by the correct level of authority, have a right of appeal against them, or are sufficient in a changing environment.

It is important, in a new department, to try to ensure continuity of powers. This is a huge task, hence the need to consult instead of putting everything in the Bill. Because many of the powers have developed over a long period to deal with specific circumstances, it is much more appropriate that we consider them in the round.<a name="st_23"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1175"--><a name="41208-07_spnew4"></a><b> Mr. Michael Fallon  (Sevenoaks) (Con):</b><!--Mr. Michael Fallon--> The Paymaster General spoke about confidentiality. Although I welcome the clause on that, confidentiality was a matter of concern to the Select Committee.

If the new department can start at the beginning of the next financial year—parliamentary process permitting—the new confidentiality requirements that I have identified will operate. I cannot express too strongly the importance that I personally—and the hon. Gentleman, the Treasury Committee and, I believe, every hon. Member—place on a clear and unambiguous commitment to protect taxpayer confidentiality with the necessary functions. It is vital for continuing compliance rates that taxpayers provide information to the Revenue departments. The bedrock of that process is the knowledge that their confidentiality is protected.

As my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary announced in September, the Bill extends the remit of Her MajestySSSQQQs inspectorate of constabulary to provide for it to inspect HMRCSSSQQQs compliance with the requirements of the criminal justice system. It also extends the remit of the Independent Police Complaints Commission, giving it a key role in considering allegations of criminal or gross misconduct by HMRC officers. Those two proposals will implement the recommendation of the Butterfield review that Customs identify how additional external scrutiny can best be introduced into investigation work. Given that<br><br><a name="column_1176"></a><br><br>the departments are merging, I hope that hon.

It also restricts the officers who could previously arrest for such Customs offences, so that only officers authorised by the commissioners to exercise the power of arrest for the offences can do that. That tightens arrest arrangements and will remove the power of arrest for the offences from several Customs and Excise officers who currently have it legally but do not need it in their current jobs and are therefore administratively barred from using it.<a name = "41208-07_para6"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dawn Primarolo"--><a name="stpa_35"></a>The Bill establishes a fully independent prosecutions office—the Revenue and Customs Prosecutions Office—to provide independent scrutiny of criminal cases investigated by HMRC.

The director may designate appropriate members of his staff as prosecutors, who will enjoy the rights and responsibilities necessary to enable them to conduct prosecutions on his behalf. All staff of the office, including prosecutors, will be subject to the directorSSSQQQs instructions.<a name = "41208-08_para1"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dawn Primarolo"--><a name="stpa_40"></a>Confidentiality remains as important an issue in the prosecutions office as it is in HMRC. The Bill therefore places a duty of confidentiality on RCPO staff, and backs this up with a criminal sanction for unlawful disclosure of information. The prosecutions office will operate to the highest possible professional standards. In order to provide independent assurance of those standards, the Bill provides for the office to be inspected by the Crown Prosecution Service inspectorate, and in a reflection of this focus on standards, the Bill sets out clear minimum requirements for qualifications, which all RCPO prosecutors must satisfy in order to be appointed to the role.<a name = "41208-08_para2"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dawn Primarolo"--><a name="stpa_41"></a>The Bill is modest, although the task that it sets in train is not, as it will involve a very substantial programme of reform and change, which will deliver incremental improvements to services over the coming years. A key challenge for HMRC management throughout the integration process will be to ensure ongoing, consistently high standards of service to taxpayers, and to ensure that the delivery of business as usual is not compromised. Indeed, this very point was identified as a risk in the Treasury CommitteeSSSQQQs report, and we are very alive to it. The House and the Treasury Committee will be pleased to hear that it is a challenge that HMRC management are absolutely committed to meeting, as am I.<a name = "41208-08_para3"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dawn Primarolo"--><a name="stpa_42"></a>The OSSSQQQDonnell review acknowledged the importance of strong leadership in managing the transition process, and I am confident that the management team led by David Varney will maintain an absolute focus on business results alongside the delivery of the new<br><br><a name="column_1179"></a><br><br>departmental structures and processes.

In 1671, King Charles II put the service into the hands of commissioners. In fact, anyone who visits Customs headquarters can see the swords that have been blunted, once used—I do not know what for—as a testament to the long history of the department. Direct taxes, in the sense of a contribution from the local community to royal expenses, are also ancient, but the modern national administration is much the younger of the two departments, dating from the introduction of income tax in 1842 and the creation of the Board of Inland Revenue in 1849. In all that time, the staff in both departments have served the House and the taxpayers of the United Kingdom to their greatest ability, and their professionalism is beyond question.<a name = "41208-08_para5"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dawn Primarolo"--><a name="stpa_44"></a>The formation of HMRC will build on the proven track records of people across Customs and the Inland Revenue, to deliver a world-class organisation that is truly fit for the 21st century. The challenge is significant, but so too is the potential for delivering real improvements in the way in which the new department does business. The Bill is a crucial first step towards delivering those improvements, and I commend it to the House.<a name="time_1"></a><a name = "41208-08_time0"></a>XZXZomit desc="time"YWYW1.28pmXZXZ/omitYWYW<a name="st_35"></a>

Therefore, task No. 1 is to protect the yield. Will this merger get more money in with fewer mistakes? If so, how much? That is the first issue that needs to be measured.<a name = "41208-08_para20"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Tyrie"--><a name="stpa_59"></a>The second objective must be to reduce the hassle for millions of individuals, and hundreds and thousands of businesses throughout the country—the so-called compliance burden.

What is her estimate?<a name = "41208-08_para21"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Tyrie"--><a name="stpa_60"></a>Two consequential questions flow from those two simple ones, and they also need answering. Are we confident enough about the possible gains in extra yield and better compliance to be able to justify what everybody agrees would be transitional costs? I refer not only to the £75 million in the explanatory notes but to the enormous disruption that will take place—the Paymaster General implied at the end of her remarks that the merger was a Herculean task, with which I agree, and that will also impose a substantial transitional cost.

Even if the benefits outweigh the costs, are we confident that we can achieve that without a decline in the high standards that Revenue departments have set themselves, including their duty of confidentiality? Will the morale of the departments suffer in the long run? In particular, we must bear in mind that both departments, particularly Customs, face major criminal efforts at evasion.<a name = "41208-08_para23"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Tyrie"--><a name="stpa_62"></a>I have set out my four tests for attempting to measure the success of a merger.

As we now have some intelligible yardsticks, how does the merger measure up to them? The first port of call should be the regulatory impact assessment, a relatively thin document for such an important issue. I can find in it no overall estimate of the effects on the yield. Virtually the whole of the economic costs and benefits are dealt with in five very short paragraphs. On efficiency savings, we are told that there will be 13,000 staff savings, but when we consider that carefully, and as the Paymaster General clarified earlier, more than 9,000 of those will come anyway under the Gershon review, even without the merger, and only 3,000—3,200 now, I think—as a result of integration. Incidentally, those figures have moved around a bit as they have been examined.<br><br><a name="column_1182"></a><br><br><a name = "41208-08_para25"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Tyrie"--><a name="stpa_64"></a>The Treasury Committee did a very good job generally on this subject. It is sensible, particularly with regard to subjects that are not absolutely urgent and immediate, that debate should take place on the basis of thorough scrutiny by Select Committees. The Treasury Committee also did a good job on this specific point, and I commend the hon. Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Plaskitt), who is in his place, and the hon. Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann), who showed in questions in Committee just how much the numbers on potential savings had moved around.<a name = "41208-08_para26"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Tyrie"--><a name="stpa_65"></a>We have arrived at the point of agreement that the Government are saying that staff savings directly from the merger will be about 3,200—just over 3 per cent. of the total work force. That is scarcely the sort of number that could justify what amounts to one of the biggest mergers in Whitehall, or indeed between any two organisations. No private sector institutions would go through all the administrative hell and business risk of a merger to secure 3 per cent. staff savings, but if we take the regulatory impact assessment at face value, that is what the Government appear to be saying as to why we should support the Bill.<a name = "41208-08_para27"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Tyrie"--><a name="stpa_66"></a>At least, that was the position in all the documentation until today. Today, the Paymaster General came up with a variation: she told us that the total merger savings amount to £500 million. I should be grateful if she could tell us whether that £500 million is directly connected to the 3,000 staff saving, or whether it is also connected to the further savings that will result from the Gershon review.<a name="st_38"></a>

The merger is not necessary for the Gershon savings, so the £500 million does not represent savings from the merger. Only a small fraction of that amount should be attributed to it. I hope that issue will be clarified later, but it illustrates a point that I was trying to make at the beginning. The true costs and benefits, and why we are going about the merger now, are not clear in the documentation before us.<br><br><a name="column_1183"></a><br><br><a name = "41208-09_para2"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Tyrie"--><a name="stpa_69"></a>The most important single question in the case of any Revenue department is "What will happen to the yield?" I can find no answer to that anywhere, but my best guess is "Not very much". That is why, although paragraph 3.43 of the OSSSQQQDonnell report refers to the tax gap—which is another way of talking about the same thing: the difference between the amount that should be collected and the amount that is collected—there is no estimate of what will happen to it as a result of the merger. I think that that should have been addressed in some of the documentation.<a name = "41208-09_para3"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Tyrie"--><a name="stpa_70"></a>While we are on the subject of staff, I want to refer to the slightly broader issue of relocation. I should be interested to know how many staff will be relocated out of London as a consequence of the Gershon review. I note that the Lyons review proposed the relocation of 500 from Customs and Excise and 1,450 from the Revenue—about 2,000 in all. How many extra jobs, if any, will be relocated as a specific consequence of the merger?<a name = "41208-09_para4"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Tyrie"--><a name="stpa_71"></a>I hope that the Paymaster General and the Economic Secretary will forgive a hint of scepticism from the Conservatives about the relocation issue. After all, is it not the case that far the biggest relocation so far is that of 1,575 staff who have moved from the Inland Revenue office of Somerset house in the Strand to the Treasury building in Whitehall? I do not think that that is the kind of relocation initiative that the Chancellor wanted us to have in mind when he announced—I will not try to reproduce his blathering rant—<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>"I am publishing department by department plans to relocate civil service jobs out of the south east".</ul><a name = "41208-09_para5"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Tyrie"--><a name="stpa_72"></a>A move from the Strand to Whitehall does not quite match that.<a name="st_42"></a>

The first of the two tests that I mentioned at the beginning was that of "getting the money in". We have virtually nothing from the Government to help us to assess the merger. What about the compliance-burden test? That is covered at length in the OSSSQQQDonnell report, which points out that companies may obtain benefits from being able to engage with only one Department to fulfil their requirements for all their taxes. Here again, however, I have not been able to spot any figures, I suspect because most of the gains—although possibly there in the long run—are extremely difficult to capture. That is because the Inland Revenue and Customs have fundamentally different sets of skills as organisations, and are trying to collect two completely different types of tax—which is why the merger did not take place decades ago.<a name = "41208-09_para7"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Tyrie"--><a name="stpa_74"></a>The Inland Revenue deals with organisations retrospectively. It is trying to capture income flows on which there is usually a great deal of ready documentation. Its approach is analytical. Customs, on<br><br><a name="column_1184"></a><br><br>the other hand, is dealing with transaction taxes. Its role is, of necessity, partly forensic—quasi-legal. It needs to capture the transaction as it happens. That is why it may not be easy for the new department to deliver the compliance gains that we should like for its customers. There is also a real danger that each organisation might find its skill sets diluted, to the benefit of neither. Of course there is the opportunity to get the best out of both skill sets, but that is easier said than done. It is a big undertaking. I think it will be particularly difficult to achieve in the next year or two, because both departments already have their hands full.<a name = "41208-09_para8"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Tyrie"--><a name="stpa_75"></a>The Inland Revenue is grappling with the task of transforming itself from a revenue collection service into a very different institution: a tax and benefits agency. As we know, it has already been a bumpy ride. Customs has its own problems. It is about to install a massive information technology system, and we know the GovernmentSSSQQQs history on those. I shall return to that subject later.<a name = "41208-09_para9"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Tyrie"--><a name="stpa_76"></a>Explanation and justification of both those crucial issues—the effect on the yield and compliance—is pretty thin. To its great credit, the Treasury Select Committee has tried to elicit some by asking questions about long-term savings, but that has not helped us to obtain a better regulatory impact assessment. When David Varney was questioned by the Treasury Committee on the gains of merger, he said that it was impossible to answer without knowing the details of the sequencing—the timetable. The Government must have done the work required to establish that by now. Will the Paymaster General give us a quantitative analysis of the costs and benefits?<a name = "41208-09_para10"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Tyrie"--><a name="stpa_77"></a>I have tried to describe how to assess whether the merger is really worth it by providing some basic yardsticks. We will of course have a couple of days in which to examine the Bill in detail in Committee, but a number of points should at least be alluded to now.<a name = "41208-09_para11"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Tyrie"--><a name="stpa_78"></a>First and most important, the Minister has been at pains to stress—it is stressed in the documents—that this is a minimalist Bill. The Paymaster General has told us that, and the regulatory impact assessment assures us of it. The regulatory impact assessment tells us of two other possibilities that the Government rejected: a more comprehensive early Bill that would make substantive changes in relation to powers, and a fully comprehensive Bill in a later legislative Session. However, I am a little worried—we will explore this issue in Committee—that the Bill might have included provisions that fall into the category of a comprehensive Bill. I noted carefully that the Paymaster General sought to provide reassurance about powers of arrest, but an initial reading of clause 29 does not give me that reassurance. It appears to extend the power of arrest to new HMRC officers.<a name = "41208-09_para12"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Tyrie"--><a name="stpa_79"></a>I was very grateful to the Paymaster General for making it clear that she will publish proposals on the powers in January; we will of course develop the proposals when we are in government. It is important that this issue—the one to which many pressure groups will pay the most assiduous attention—be given a full airing, and I am pleased that there will be a consultative document as early as January. The advice note on powers has only just been published, so I was unable to read it before todaySSSQQQs debate, but I shall read it carefully as soon as I can.<br><br><a name="column_1185"></a><br><br><a name = "41208-09_para13"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Tyrie"--><a name="stpa_80"></a>Another significant issue, which the Paymaster General hardly touched on, is policy formulation. My best guess is that the lionSSSQQQs share of the 1,500 people who are moving from the Strand all the way to the Treasury will be doing policy work. In justifying the new policy arrangements, Mr. OSSSQQQDonnell has sought to distinguish between strategic policy and policy maintenance. I have thought quite a bit about this distinction. Is it really helpful? Perhaps it is in theory, but I am not sure that it will be in practice. The current arrangements work reasonably well. I could not help feeling that the ghost of Sir Humphrey—or perhaps I should say Lord Bridges—was lurking in Mr. OSSSQQQDonnellSSSQQQs lengthy description of the distinction between strategic policy and policy maintenance.<a name="st_44"></a>

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1185"--><a name="41208-10_spnew0"></a><b> Mr. Andrew Tyrie:</b><!--Mr. Andrew Tyrie--> As I have said, it is the politicians, not the officials, who should be blamed.

Eventually, it will have a corrosive and sclerotic influence on the economySSSQQQs performance. I do not want to blame Treasury officials; rather, I put the blame fairly and squarely at MinistersSSSQQQ door. In many cases, these often distributional reforms have been pushed through with the best of intentions, but in the long run they are likely to have the opposite effect to the intended one. If one presses the right buttons in respect of the officials, one gets the right results. I am sure that the new arrangements can be made to work—a way will be found to make them work—but I am simply trying to point out that I am not absolutely sure that this apparently major reshuffle will make much difference to the overall quality of policy work.<a name = "41208-10_para0"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Tyrie"--><a name="stpa_81"></a>There are a few more issues that I want to touch on, and which we shall discuss in more detail in Committee. The first is information sharing and confidentiality, to which the Paymaster General referred. Clause 16 and schedule 2 enable the use of information acquired by the Revenue and Customs in connection with a function for any other function. Before integration, information could be passed between the Revenue and Customs only through statutory gateways. As I understand it, the Bill will enable the new department to pool all its information, irrespective of the purpose for which it was originally obtained. That issue could also be of concern, and we need to examine it carefully in Committee.<a name="st_46"></a>

As I said at the outset, if it can be shown that relaxing the gateways could increase yield, such a provision might be worth considering carefully, but it must be balanced against the consequential risk to confidentiality.<a name = "41208-10_para1"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Tyrie"--><a name="stpa_82"></a>It is vital that nothing in the Bill threatens taxpayer confidentiality. If people do not have confidence in the Revenue department, they will not share information and the tax yield will suffer. According to clause 19, information can be disclosed "in the public interest", but the explanatory notes provide little clarification. I should be grateful for an explanation of the meaning behind this apparent widening of the disclosure provisions.<a name = "41208-10_para2"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Tyrie"--><a name="stpa_83"></a>On reading the OSSSQQQDonnell review, I was also somewhat apprehensive at discovering that the new Bill provides<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a>"an opportunity to consider gateways with other departments, such as DWP."</ul><a name = "41208-10_para3"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Tyrie"--><a name="stpa_84"></a>I should be grateful if the Paymaster General would tell us to what extent the opening of gateways to other Departments has been considered and what decision has been arrived at.<a name = "41208-10_para4"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Tyrie"--><a name="stpa_85"></a>I am surprised and disappointed by the GovernmentSSSQQQs decision to abolish the oath that officers are expected to take and to read out in front of a witness—it is properly known as the statutory declaration—thereby impressing on them their duty of confidentiality. The Law Society told the Treasury Committee that there would be advantages in restating the Inland Revenue oath in legislation, so that it is made clear that officials keep taxpayersSSSQQQ information confidential. I agree, and I am really perplexed by the GovernmentSSSQQQs decision to abolish it. It is used in courts for witnesses, and we swear the Oath of Allegiance before we can take our seats in the House. The oath has previously been the subject of much controversy, but many hon. Members feel that it should be used even for witnesses who appear before Select Committees, particularly during major investigations; in other words, they feel that the use of the oath should be extended. Keeping the oath of confidentiality would certainly do no harm, and might even do some good. I find it difficult to justify its removal.<a name="st_48"></a>

Do the Government have a contingency plan for weaknesses in IT that they could publish, and can we please have it before we consider the Bill in Committee?

My hon. Friend the Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois) will discuss it in greater detail later, but let me give a few brief examples. The Child Support AgencySSSQQQs computer system, which cost nearly £500 million, recently failed and staff at the Department for Work and Pensions were unable recently to process new benefits and pension claims for several days because the system went down. The computer systems of the Passport Service, the Criminal Records Bureau and National Air Traffic Services have also had problems. And so we go on.<a name="st_52"></a>

I support in principle the creation of a new prosecuting authority, but we need to look carefully at the detail in Committee. That new authority is, in its way, the single most important direct, clear and visible change made as a consequence of the merger. Outsiders will see it and it is extremely important that we get it right. Rather than go into detail now—I notice that I have been going on for more than half an hour—let us leave that for examination in Committee.<a name = "41208-10_para9"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Tyrie"--><a name="stpa_90"></a>I want to make a general point before concluding. Many business people say that when they deal with the Inland Revenue at its best, they are having a conversation with someone who is thinking carefully about the needs of the business as well as a narrow calculation of the yield. Both parties know that accounting practice can vary and that recourse to the law will probably not help very much. The idea that they should always pay exactly the correct amount of tax in any one year needs to be taken in the light of the fact that accounting practices vary and companiesSSSQQQ decisions can alter liability in any particular year. The Revenue knows<br><br><a name="column_1188"></a><br><br>that most companies do not want to break the law and do not want to find themselves on the wrong side of the Revenue, so a modus vivendi delivers the yield.<a name = "41208-10_para10"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Tyrie"--><a name="stpa_91"></a>We should compare that with Customs. As the Paymaster General said, anyone who walks into its headquarters—I have not done so for a few years, but my opportunity will come shortly—is confronted with a wall laden with cutlasses. That shows that its history and approach are closer to that of a police force than a revenue service. The Revenue has had many decades of dealing with reluctant but honest men and women. Customs has had rather more experience of chasing dishonest men and women. It is still chasing smugglers and other highly organised criminals who seek to evade the excise. I spoke earlier about the blending of cultures and it is crucial that we pick up the best of each. In many ways, that means the Revenue showing Customs what can be achieved on the basis of its culture, whereby dealing with basically honest but often busy business men brings about more co-operation and yields more tax.<a name = "41208-10_para11"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Tyrie"--><a name="stpa_92"></a>This has been a long speech—probably longer than I thought it would take to deliver, but still a good deal shorter than that of the Paymaster General.<a name="st_54"></a>

Gladstone was first against it and then, as with so many issues—home rule, the great Reform Act, extension of the franchise—eventually in favour of it. It took him about 20 years to change his mind about the merger of the Departments, but this Government have stood on their heads in a mere four years.<a name = "41208-11_para1"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Tyrie"--><a name="stpa_94"></a>The GovernmentSSSQQQs response to the Select CommitteeSSSQQQs first report on the matter in 2000 said that they believed that the synergies<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a>"can be achieved without the risks, upfront and opportunity costs and structural upheaval which merger would inevitably entail . . .

Four years later, we are told that it is worth the candle. Why the volte-face? I hope that it is because the Government have done a good deal of backroom work, which they have not yet published, and that they will shortly show us that the real benefits of the Bill relate to protection of the yield and reduced compliance. I hope that they will be able to add some numbers and some substance to their claims and be able to quantify the so-called synergies in order to produce a sensible estimate of the full benefits of the merger.<a name = "41208-11_para3"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Tyrie"--><a name="stpa_96"></a>I hope so, but I fear not. I fear that the Government have not been feeding on the pure milk of administrative common sense, but have taken a dose of raw politics. They have sharply increased the size of the civil service. In the Revenue departments alone, the number of civil servants has increased by more than a third in seven<br><br><a name="column_1189"></a><br><br>years, from 73,000 to almost 100,000. The public—the Labour partySSSQQQs focus groups will have told them this—made it clear that they did not believe that they were getting value for money, and they were probably right. So the Chancellor had his Gershon review, and subsequently put the whole recruitment drive for the civil service sharply into reverse. But he could hardly go around telling other Departments to put their recruitment into reverse without having a look at his own. I believe that that matter explains, at least partly, the timing of the Bill.<a name = "41208-11_para4"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Tyrie"--><a name="stpa_97"></a>There may be some benefits from the merger, but they are not necessarily great. The two Departments have developed different styles and different cultures for very good reasons. As a result, capturing the benefits will take a long time and will not be easy. There are attendant costs and risks. Conservative Members will not oppose the Bill, but we would like to see much more evidence that the Government have carefully thought through what they are trying to achieve with the Bill and what their ultimate objectives are. We would also like to see more evidence that the Government know how to accomplish them, but we have not heard much evidence today.<a name="time_2"></a><a name = "41208-11_time0"></a>XZXZomit desc="time"YWYW2.8pmXZXZ/omitYWYW<a name="st_56"></a>

On the face of it, as the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) touched on, it is a peculiar coupling. Customs and Excise has an image of speed boats and James Bond activity in remote inlets of the coast, whereas the Inland Revenue has the Bob Cratchit quill-pen image of someone at home in a dusty office with ledgers. That is not how it seems to many business people, who deal with one set of people to pay VAT and another set to pay company and income tax.<a name = "41208-11_para5"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Nigel Beard"--><a name="stpa_98"></a>Bringing those two cultures together with compatible IT systems will ostensibly lead to savings, as already mentioned, but realising the potential benefits that are pointed out in the OSSSQQQDonnell report needs managing—indeed, a degree of management that has not always been apparent in the past. That said, we must not lose sight of the wood for the trees. The dominant and primary objective of this merger is not cost saving in organisation: the overriding aim must be to reduce the gap between the potential revenue to the Government from tax and what is realised. That tax gap is too large.<a name = "41208-11_para6"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Nigel Beard"--><a name="stpa_99"></a>The touchstone of success of this merger is not some recondite measure of administrative efficiency—it is the reduction, virtually to elimination if possible, of tax evasion. The amount of tax currently not paid by those who should pay VAT or company tax or income tax would make a significant contribution to the national accounts. At the same time, we must foresee and minimize the impact of new tax policy on the competitiveness of businesses.<a name = "41208-11_para7"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Nigel Beard"--><a name="stpa_100"></a>In that context, I welcome the proposal for retaining an ability to assess the business impact of tax proposals within the new organisation, while at the same time strengthening the TreasurySSSQQQs ability to assess the overall<br><br><a name="column_1190"></a><br><br>effect of tax policy. If there are to be adverse effects of new taxes, at least we should expect that they were known about and weighed against the benefits of the tax. Normally, we should expect that adverse effects are anticipated, and eliminated as much as possible.<a name = "41208-11_para8"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Nigel Beard"--><a name="stpa_101"></a>Above all, we must avoid the costs that honest organisations face in complying with tax law.

More generally, the accounting needed for tax purposes could be brought nearer to the principles involved in normal company accounts. I hope that the new tax policy unit will home in on such issues.<a name = "41208-11_para10"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Nigel Beard"--><a name="stpa_103"></a>A great gain for many businesses will be that they will have to deal with one inspector only for VAT, company tax and income tax.

Duty-free spirits were donated to the back doors of public houses throughout south-east England on a grand scale. They left the bonded warehouse heading for the continent, and so no duty was paid on them. However, they had a regular habit of turning round at the sight of the channel and returning to London. Once that was spotted, an exercise was established for acquiring the evidence needed for prosecution. The Exchequer lost the unbelievable sum of £670 million just in the process of gathering the evidence.<a name = "41208-11_para12"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Nigel Beard"--><a name="stpa_105"></a>Then there was the case of Regina<i>v</i>. Doran, a large-scale drug dealer. He was caught redhanded in possession of a huge haul of class A drugs. Someone had to try really hard to allow him to avoid due punishment, but the case failed because of a legal mix-up in mounting the prosecution. After those two cases, the Roques report looked into the management and administration of Customs and Excise, and the Butterfield report analysed whether Customs and Excise should have its powers to mount independent prosecutions taken away.<a name = "41208-11_para13"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Nigel Beard"--><a name="stpa_106"></a>The Treasury Sub-Committee was assured that the findings of those two inquiries had now been acted upon. That is no doubt true, but I should like an assurance from the new chairman, Mr. Varney, that he is personally satisfied that these events could not be repeated in the new organisation. The Sub-Committee was not reassured when the previous Customs and Excise chairman was asked for an assurance that staff vetting procedures were such that no one with a criminal record could be employed in Customs and Excise. The answer was no, he could not give us that assurance.<a name = "41208-11_para14"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Nigel Beard"--><a name="stpa_107"></a>Likewise, action against cigarette smuggling is not reassuring. A few years ago, no duty was paid on one in four cigarettes sold in Britain. That 25 per cent. has been brought down to 18 per cent. but many cigarettes are still being smuggled, at a cost to the Exchequer of around £2.5 billion per annum.<br><br><a name="column_1191"></a><br><br><a name = "41208-11_para15"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Nigel Beard"--><a name="stpa_108"></a>The cigarettes in question were not made of mud and brick dust in a shanty town. They were made by three major UK companies—British American Tobacco, Gallahers and Imperial Tobacco Ltd, with the Government health warning printed on the side of packets. The total estimate of smuggled cigarettes in 2002–03 was about 12 billion, out of a total consumption of 75 billion. With duty avoided on that scale, I cannot believe that no one in those major companies knew what was going on.<a name = "41208-11_para16"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Nigel Beard"--><a name="stpa_109"></a>At a recent meeting of the Treasury Sub-Committee, we were told that progress had been made and that the companies involved had signed a memorandum of understanding to co-operate in reducing cigarette smuggling. So three major companies have decided that they are willing to co-operate in enforcing the law of the land, but that leaves rather up in the air the question of what went on before the memorandum.

If anything, the approach seems to have been lackadaisical and benignly indulgent. The great fallacy would be to assume that, because we are setting up a new organisation, all the observations in the Roques and Butterfield reports would be complied with immediately. They will not be, unless there is a clear determination, and a management ethos, to crack down on the cheats and frauds mercilessly.<a name = "41208-11_para19"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Nigel Beard"--><a name="stpa_112"></a>The message that I should like to see go out from this debate to Mr. Varney, the chairman, and to his management team is that he should stick to the customer friendly approach for the honest taxpayer, but use every power available against the dishonest ones. If he does not have enough powers, he should come back and ask for more.<a name = "41208-11_para20"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Nigel Beard"--><a name="stpa_113"></a>There is a heavy dependence on management to put right the inadequacies that I have outlined. Legislation is not enough. The management arrangements of the Inland Revenue, as evidence to the Treasury Sub-Committee has shown, do not lead to unqualified confidence. The sale of all the Inland RevenueSSSQQQs properties on lease-back to a company registered in a tax haven did not imply a management with a highly developed sense of the ridiculous. Nor was a sense of worldliness obvious when a so-called comfort letter was given to the buyer that breached Treasury directives that apply to every Government Department.

However, the proposal for the executive chairman to report to three different Ministers on different aspects of the organisation is a formula for confusion, delay and blurred accountability. It is important that the new organisation hits the ground running and puts the past behind it. A first year with management distracted by a flurry of memos around Treasury departments and fruitless co-ordination meetings will not achieve that. I hope that the Sub-CommitteeSSSQQQs recommendation that this arrangement should be looked at again will be acted on, not when the confusion has happened but without delay.<a name = "41208-11_para22"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Nigel Beard"--><a name="stpa_115"></a>This Bill is a good basic framework that recognises the inadequacies that have arisen in the past in both Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue. However, it must not be seen as a ritual incantation that in itself will provide a revenue and customs service relevant to the 21st century. It needs complementing by a highly motivated staff, who are managed to make full use of their abilities, directed to achieve clear objectives and provided with investment in technology. All that is vital to them ensuring that the taxation that this House votes for is fairly levied on everyone who has a lawful duty to pay. I am sure that the good wishes of this House go out to all who will be involved in an endeavour that is so fundamental to the life of this country.

That is an accurate assessment of the position and I pay tribute to those bodies, such as the Treasury Committee, whose Chairman and other members have been in their places today, for their work in drawing attention to the potential benefits of merger. I am especially pleased that they have indicated that they will continue to track the progress of this merger over the next few years, because that will be important.<a name = "41208-12_para1"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. David Laws"--><a name="stpa_117"></a>We share many of the detailed concerns that the hon.

Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Beard), who is also a member of the Treasury Committee, emphasised in his contribution the importance of addressing the tax gap through the merger of the two departments. The Paymaster General gave a long, detailed and helpful speech, but the one area on which she was a little light was an emphasis on how, over time, the merger will seek to address that important issue. I am glad that the hon.

Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) and by many of the professional bodies about how the merger will work in practice, and we share Martin TaylorSSSQQQs view—set out in his submission to Gus OSSSQQQDonnell—that the change will be risky, perhaps very risky. We also share the view of the Law Society that major gains could be made from the merger if it is conducted well. The devil will be in the detail and the delivery of the changes. If the Government and those people responsible for delivering and implementing the merger get the detail and the delivery wrong, what could be a triumph—in the GovernmentSSSQQQs mind—could turn into a disaster. It is the risks on which I shall concentrate, bearing in mind that the Bill is essentially a modest mechanism to get the merger up and running, leaving some of the important decisions about powers for consultation and implementation to a later date.<a name = "41208-12_para3"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. David Laws"--><a name="stpa_119"></a>I shall start by setting out the points of agreement with the Government. The first is that although there are many areas in the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise with no obvious overlap in responsibilities, we can see the potential for cost savings within the new department and in compliance for businesses. We also believe that there is a potential for improving action against tax evasion and avoidance. In our view, and as the Treasury Committee concluded—the Government appear to agree—those gains are more likely to be secured by a merged department than by keeping the two departments separate and trying to institute measures to ensure co-operation between the departments, including some of the measures that have been in place in recent years.<a name = "41208-12_para4"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. David Laws"--><a name="stpa_120"></a>The second reason we support this change is that although it will lead to considerable overhauling of the two departments and, potentially, some disturbance to their activities in the next few years, I would be very surprised if it did not expose the scope for doing business considerably better and at less cost. When I was in the private sector, one particular company used to refer to Spanish practices that built up over time and institutionalised inefficiencies. I am not sure that it is politically correct to refer to such practices in that way now, but I am sure that the merger will reveal areas where things could be done considerably better.<a name = "41208-12_para5"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. David Laws"--><a name="stpa_121"></a>Thirdly, we welcome the mechanism through which the Government will deliver the merger. The OSSSQQQDonnell report clearly set out different options for the Government in proceeding with the merger, including legislating rapidly for the new department on issues such as its powers or taking a more leisurely approach and allowing plenty of time for consultation on the powers of the new department. The Government have taken a sensible approach in introducing this modest enabling Bill and leaving time and scope for consultation. We share the welcome voiced by the hon. Member for Chichester for a consultation paper in January that will allow people an early chance to feed their views into the Finance Bill for 2006, regardless of which party will then be in power.<a name = "41208-12_para6"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. David Laws"--><a name="stpa_122"></a>The fourth area of agreement is on the establishment of a new Revenue and Customs Prosecution Office. As my hon.

Gentleman, although I acknowledge that he has more experience and skills in such matters, so I may be making a mistake. Nevertheless, I welcome the fact that the Government will take back some control over strategic leadership on tax policy from the two departments and put it in the Treasury.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1194"--><a name="41208-12_spnew2"></a><b> Mr. David Laws:</b><!--Mr. David Laws--> The Paymaster General may not nod so enthusiastically at my next point. I believe that considerable weakness and lack of coherence has been evident in tax policy for a long period. There has been a lack of assessment of the costs and benefits of new tax proposals. Tax changes have appeared to follow short-term political imperatives and the initiatives brought forward by the Chancellor, or have followed attempts to plug tax loopholes as they emerge, no doubt on the sensible advice of the two Revenue departments, rather than being part of a coherent, long-term tax strategy.<a name = "41208-12_para8"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Laws"--><a name="stpa_124"></a>I pray in aid the OSSSQQQDonnell report, which said that<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a>"the precise formal role of each department is"—</ul><a name = "41208-12_para9"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Laws"--><a name="stpa_125"></a>in other words, has been—<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a>"ill defined."</ul><a name = "41208-12_para10"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Laws"--><a name="stpa_126"></a>That refers to the two Revenue departments and the Treasury. On page 99, the report also implies that at present Treasury officials—and the Treasury as a whole—may be more reactive than proactive in relation to tax policy. The report talks of ministerial policy initiatives and the co-ordination and presentation of overall tax policy—an important part of the GovernmentSSSQQQs work on tax—but says little about setting a broad tax strategy. I hope that the new approach to management of such matters will leave much of the expertise in developing tax policy in the new merged department, especially in relation to anti-evasion and avoidance activity. I hope that it will also lead to a more strategic perspective in the Treasury. This is certainly an opportunity for a more strategic approach to tax policy, which many businesses would welcome. It would also bring about an obligation to be more strategic on tax policy and to simplify taxation.<a name = "41208-12_para11"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Laws"--><a name="stpa_127"></a>As the Chartered Institute of Taxation said in its paper on the benefits of the merger for business:<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a>"We consider that merger creates an additional need for simplicity";</ul><a name = "41208-12_para12"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Laws"--><a name="stpa_128"></a>not least if the staff in the new merged department are really able to interact with customers, particularly business customers, as part of a one-shop stop. In that regard, Martin Taylor, in his submission to the OSSSQQQDonnell report, said that<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a>"integration of tax administration would be more likely to succeed if backed by a Government commitment to simplification as part of the enterprise agenda".</ul><a name="st_60"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1194"--><a name="41208-12_spnew3"></a><b> Mr. Andrew Tyrie:</b><!--Mr. Andrew Tyrie--> I agree with much of what the hon.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1195"--><a name="41208-12_spnew4"></a><b> Mr. David Laws:</b><!--Mr. David Laws--> The hon. Gentleman is right: ultimately, Ministers have accountability for determining tax strategy and pursuing it. I am sure he is also right to say that revenue Departments and Treasury officials, if given clear and helpful advice about how Ministers want the tax system to develop, would deliver the necessary policies. However, my sense of the way things have worked in practice over recent years is that that has not actually happened, partly perhaps because much of the tax policy expertise has been in the individual revenue Departments rather than centrally. I may be naive in thinking that this reform will change that aspect of the system, but I live in hope.<a name = "41208-12_para13"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Laws"--><a name="stpa_129"></a>As we debate the detail of the Bill, we must remember that many people outside in the real world, especially in the business world, will not be as interested in the small elements and small changes in the Bill as in what it will mean over time for the tax system as a whole. David Frost, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, summed up the general view of tax practitioners and business men about the British tax system when he wrote recently:<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a>"BritainSSSQQQs tax system has come into being piece by piece over the years . . . often without regard to the complexity of the whole.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1195"--><a name="41208-13_spnew1"></a><b> Mr. David Laws:</b><!--Mr. David Laws--> I agree with my hon. Friend. He is absolutely right to suggest that change in the location of the policy-making bodies for tax should in no way compromise taxpayer confidentiality. The Government have already given certain guarantees about that and we shall obviously be able to probe them in more detail in Committee.<a name = "41208-13_para0"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Laws"--><a name="stpa_131"></a>I have covered the points of agreement in our approach to the Bill, so now I want to consider some of the aspects that are of greater concern to us and to pick up some of the points raised by the hon. Member for Chichester. I shall start by focusing on the GovernmentSSSQQQs objectives in introducing the Bill and the problems that are likely to arise in its implementation. I share the concerns of the hon. Gentleman about whether the Government have a clear sense of the ranking of the achievements and objectives<br><br><a name="column_1196"></a><br><br>they want to secure through the Bill. At least three have been mentioned frequently: increased efficiency, reduced compliance costs for business and more effective tax gathering. Do the Government have a clear sense of the ranking of those priorities?<a name = "41208-13_para1"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Laws"--><a name="stpa_132"></a>Over recent months, we have heard much from all political parties about the need to make savings in Government expenditure. Indeed, we have heard a lot from both the Government and the Conservative party about the need to make administrative savings in Government expenditure. Much of the context for the announcement of the Bill focuses on efficiency savings and job cuts but not on the possibly bigger issue raised earlier by the hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford—the tax gap. Is the Chancellor giving short-term cost reduction too high a priority, or giving it too high an emphasis over more important objectives? Concern about that seems widespread not only among employees and their representatives—we should expect them to be worried about reductions in staff numbers—but also among professionals who have commented on the Bill.<a name = "41208-13_para2"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Laws"--><a name="stpa_133"></a>Those people are right to be concerned about whether the GovernmentSSSQQQs focus is simply on securing efficiency savings. After all, when the Chancellor announced the merger of Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue in his 2004 Budget statement, he did so in the context of securing value for money, as he put it, in a section of his speech where he announced—with, I understand, no previous consultation with employee groups—a gross reduction of about 54,000 staff in the Department for Work and Pensions, Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue. As one of the witnesses to the Select Committee said,<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a>"any private organisation which had announced job cuts in that way would be vilified".</ul><a name="st_64"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1196"--><a name="41208-13_spnew2"></a><b> Dawn Primarolo:</b><!--Dawn Primarolo--> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely wrong to say that there was no discussion with representative bodies of the two departments before the Budget announcement. My hon. Friend the Economic Secretary and I, as the Ministers with responsibility for those departments, had long discussions with the unions on how to modernise, and how to make savings and efficiencies to move forward in those departments. On the very day that the announcements were made, we briefed them on that matter, so what the hon. Gentleman says is not true; the discussions were of long standing.<a name="st_65"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1196"--><a name="41208-13_spnew3"></a><b> Mr. David Laws:</b><!--Mr. David Laws--> I am grateful to the Paymaster General for clarifying that point and obviously I accept her comments, but will she accept that many Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise staff learned about the plans through hearing them announced on the radio or on television or by hearing the announcement made in the House of Commons? It appeared to many people that the plans were driven by the GovernmentSSSQQQs political need to face down many of the criticisms made by the Conservatives about wasteful public expenditure rather than by a focus on the best way to manage the important resource of staffing in those departments.<a name="st_66"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1196"--><a name="41208-13_spnew4"></a><b> Dawn Primarolo:</b><!--Dawn Primarolo--> The hon. Gentleman is wrong again. Both departments have a good history of partnership working with the representative trade<br><br><a name="column_1197"></a><br><br>unions. As the Gershon review was being worked on—not just on the day of the ChancellorSSSQQQs speech—my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary and I ensured that at each point the representative bodies knew the nature of the discussions and the likely progress that would be made.<a name="st_67"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1197"--><a name="41208-13_spnew5"></a><b> Mr. David Laws:</b><!--Mr. David Laws--> I do not want to get bogged down on that particular point. Having discussed the issue with local representatives of the Inland Revenue offices in my area, I can tell the Paymaster General that they seem to feel strongly about the way in which the announcement was made, and the Government should be acutely aware of that in terms of taking staff on board for a strategy that will mean considerable change.<a name = "41208-13_para3"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Laws"--><a name="stpa_134"></a>To return to the GovernmentSSSQQQs presentation of the matter, on 23 November, the Gracious Speech announced the merger in the context of<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a>"reducing bureaucracy and the costs of Government".</ul><a name = "41208-13_para4"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Laws"--><a name="stpa_135"></a>In other words, the focus was very much on efficiency, costs and the staffing savings that could be made rather than on the tax gap—the point raised by the hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford earlier.<a name = "41208-13_para5"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Laws"--><a name="stpa_136"></a>As earlier exchanges in the debate showed, and the hon. Member for Chichester highlighted, there is considerable uncertainty about what the economics of the merger are. I hope that the Economic Secretary will be able to clarify an important point about the £507 million savings when he sums up the debate. My understanding is that the savings of £507 million over the spending review period relate to the total reduction in staff numbers, now set at 12,500 jobs net—16,000 jobs gross—rather than the 3,200 job cuts that relate specifically to the merger of the departments. I should think that 3,200 job cuts equate roughly to savings of £75 million or £100 million a year, cumulating upwards over a period of time as the cuts take place. I do not see how the Government can get to a figure of £507 million over the spending review period, unless they are doing what the Paymaster General earlier criticised the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner) for doing—conflating the general Gershon savings with the impact of the merger savings.<a name = "41208-13_para6"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Laws"--><a name="stpa_137"></a>We also know from the GovernmentSSSQQQs regulatory impact assessment—thin though that is on the monetary costs and benefits of the merger—that certain costs will arise as a consequence of the merger. The Government put those costs at £75 million for the two years 2004–05 and 2005–06. Presumably, that is just a small portion of the costs that will arise as a consequence of the merger, particularly given that the figure relates to two years and that not much expenditure will be incurred in the first year, 2004–05.<a name = "41208-13_para7"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Laws"--><a name="stpa_138"></a>Standing back, as the hon. Member for Chichester sought to do, and assessing whether the Government will make any such efficiency saving at all over the period of the spending review and, indeed, over the rest of the decade, I have considerable scepticism about whether any net saving will be made from the merger. When the Economic Secretary replies to the debate, I would welcome any clarification on whether he expects any net saving during either the period of the spending review or the rest of the decade from the merger.<br><br><a name="column_1198"></a><br><br><a name = "41208-13_para8"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Laws"--><a name="stpa_139"></a>My confidence in the GovernmentSSSQQQs lack of clarity about such things is reinforced by the OSSSQQQDonnell report, which says on page 63, in section 3.99:<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a>"when Jobcentre Plus was created the benefit of providing a unified contact point . . . in terms of efficiencies, job outcomes, and reductions in fraud and error, were projected to equal the investment cost within seven to eight years."</ul><a name = "41208-13_para9"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Laws"--><a name="stpa_140"></a>In other words, it may be well into the next decade before any net annual saving is made from the merger of the Departments.<a name = "41208-13_para10"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Laws"--><a name="stpa_141"></a>Does it really matter whether the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Gracious Speech are rather over-hyping the potential to make efficiency savings, while the Government quietly, sensibly and rather elusively indicate in their own assessments that there may not be any net saving? I am not sure whether that is simply an issue of presentation, about which we should not concern ourselves. If the Government in presenting the merger and its justification put a great premium on the possible staff and efficiency savings and the Government are competing with other parties in the run-up to the general election to promise reductions in civil service numbers, a great deal of pressure could be put on the new department to make savings in staff numbers that might not be borne out by the sensible economies that the department would implement if left to its own devices.<a name = "41208-13_para11"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Laws"--><a name="stpa_142"></a>That point marries with the point made by the hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford, and it was made very effectively in an article in<i>The</i><i>Tax Journal</i> by John Davidson of Baker Tilly on 19 April 2004, where he says:<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a>"If the motivation for the merger is to save money and to cut jobs, it could be to the long-term detriment of the Revenue and the taxpayer. It will save a large sum of money. At the average salary cost, the loss of 10,500 will give a saving of £267 million. This, however, is just 0.08 per cent. of the revenue raised by the two departments".</ul><a name = "41208-13_para12"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Laws"--><a name="stpa_143"></a>In the year that he cited, that revenue was £338 billion, and I think that I heard the Paymaster General say earlier that it was rising to £400 billion over the period that we are considering. The article continues:<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a>"If job cuts cause a 0.1 per cent. loss of revenue, the savings"—</ul><a name = "41208-13_para13"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Laws"--><a name="stpa_144"></a>even those excluding the cost of the merger—<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a>"will not have been worthwhile."</ul><a name = "41208-13_para14"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Laws"--><a name="stpa_145"></a>The importance of the contribution made by the hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford is underlined by the similar point that Martin Taylor makes in his contribution to Gus OSSSQQQDonnellSSSQQQs report. He says:<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a>"the reduction of the tax gap is far the bigger prize, and should be the priority rather than costs . . . this should be made clear to the new management, who should not be judged primarily on the attainment of secondary objectives."</ul><a name = "41208-13_para15"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Laws"--><a name="stpa_146"></a>That is exactly right, and the Paymaster General very helpfully and honestly acknowledged—she need not look worried when I say that—in her earlier comments that the 3,200 staff reduction figure from the merger is itself a guess.<a name = "41208-13_para16"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Laws"--><a name="stpa_147"></a>The Inland Revenue officials who gave evidence to the Treasury Sub-Committee, which is chaired by the hon. Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon), were clear that the 3,200 figure was taken from guestimates of previous changes, including those in the Department for Work and Pensions. So it could be that the 3,200 figure is unlikely to be delivered and that Mr. Varney could find<br><br><a name="column_1199"></a><br><br>himself working to promises that he has given to the Government to deliver staff reductions that he would not want to bear out in practice. I hope that when the Economy Secretary replies to the debate, he will give us a clear undertaking that he and the Paymaster General will advise the chairman to focus on reducing the tax gap and compliance costs and only to reduce staff numbers when the Government can be sure that doing so will not damage those two other objectives.<a name = "41208-13_para17"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Laws"--><a name="stpa_148"></a>I take some hope from David VarneySSSQQQs contribution to Gus OSSSQQQDonnellSSSQQQs report, where he wrote:<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a>"It will be a challenge to keep a long-term focus on the effectiveness prizes and not fall prey to the temptation to substitute short-term cost reduction objectives."</ul><a name = "41208-13_para18"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Laws"--><a name="stpa_149"></a>David Varney knows very well what the priorities are, and I hope that the Economic Secretary and the Paymaster General will strongly support him in ensuring that those are the priorities. I wonder therefore whether the Economic Secretary could give us more information about those very important issues that relate to the mergerSSSQQQs economic costs and benefits. Will he give us a time scale for the reduction of 3,200 jobs in the merger; or is that figure so uncertain that no time scale can be offered?<a name = "41208-13_para19"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Laws"--><a name="stpa_150"></a>Will the Economic Secretary be absolutely clear with us about whether the £500 million savings relate to the merger or to the Gershon savings? Can the Government give us any guestimates of what the net savings will be from the merger over this spending review period, let alone any further round? Can the Economic Secretary give us any indication of whether there will be any net saving over the spending review period?<a name = "41208-13_para20"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Laws"--><a name="stpa_151"></a>Will any of the 3,200 job losses result from outsourcing in the two departments? I understand that Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue have different arrangements governing the extent to which they outsource work. I am sure that the Economic Secretary would not want any pressure to be put on the new department artificially to reduce job numbers by outsourcing, rather than doing what is in its best economic interests. In particular, is there any plan to outsource the debt collection facility of the combined department?<a name = "41208-13_para21"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Laws"--><a name="stpa_152"></a>On the number of total employees, is the Economic Secretary confident that both departments are able to carry out their current work, particularly with tax credits, which have caused a lot of problems recently, not least because of the huge backlogs at the call centre. Is the Economic Secretary confident that, despite the job losses, the combined department will be able to introduce the new proposals on child trust funds?<a name = "41208-13_para22"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Laws"--><a name="stpa_153"></a>The hon. Member for Chichester is right to draw attention to the fact that the job numbers at the Inland Revenue and in the combined department appear to have increased quite a lot since 1997–98, but the OSSSQQQDonnell report makes it clear that all the increase in job numbers at the combined department is a consequence of additional burdens imposed on the department in relation to issues such as tax credit, while the underlying number of staff who carry out the work that was done before 1997 has fallen slightly. We want to ensure that the staff are there to do those important jobs, particularly in relation to tax credits on which the lowest income people in the country depend.<a name = "41208-13_para23"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Laws"--><a name="stpa_154"></a>I want to probe the GovernmentSSSQQQs thinking on a couple of other issues. Following the concern about the lack of clarity about costs and staffing, the second issue<br><br><a name="column_1200"></a><br><br>is the GovernmentSSSQQQs expected improvement in compliance-related activity. It was clear from Gus OSSSQQQDonnellSSSQQQs evidence to the Treasury Committee that even the Government accept that there is currently a huge tax gap in the United Kingdom. Mr. OSSSQQQDonnellSSSQQQs evidence indicated that that gap was likely to be around 8 to 10 per cent. of revenues, which is in the order of magnitude of £30 billion or £40 billion.<a name = "41208-13_para24"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Laws"--><a name="stpa_155"></a>It is unusual for such an estimate to be volunteered by a senior Government official because the Government tend to be sensitive about acknowledging the extent of the problem of tax evasion and tax avoidance. Given that that figure has been put into the public domain and that Mr. OSSSQQQDonnell was willing to acknowledge that the figure for uncollected VAT alone is estimated by the Government as 12 per cent.—£12 billion a year that would be collected if people adhered to the letter of the tax law—I am interested to know whether they anticipate that the tax gap will be closed in any way by the merger of the two departments.<a name = "41208-13_para25"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Laws"--><a name="stpa_156"></a>I should have liked the Paymaster General to say more about the detail of how the Government plan to close that enormous tax gap, which after all is the central purpose of the two departments. We can talk as long as we want about improving service to customers, but, as the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) pointed out robustly in the evidence taken by the Select Committee, ultimately the purpose of the departments is to collect revenue for the GovernmentSSSQQQs public services and other priorities. If £30 billion or £40 billion is going missing, it needs to be a high priority for the new department to tackle.<a name = "41208-13_para26"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Laws"--><a name="stpa_157"></a>On compliance, the new department must focus on those entities who are in the black economy, and who are probably avoiding contact with both Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue, rather than simply focusing all efforts on the largely compliant group of businesses and taxpayers, which could be easier targets for it. Have the Government recently estimated the compliance cost to business, one of the recommendations by the Treasury Committee in its report in 2000? Will there be an opportunity, either now or in the year ahead, to estimate the savings to business from the reduction in compliance activity? Has the Economic Secretary considered whether the tax system, in particular the business tax system, can be simplified to reduce the compliance burdens on business?<a name="st_68"></a>

The union wants the new department to do its job properly and wants it to be properly resourced.<a name = "41208-14_para5"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Kelvin Hopkins"--><a name="stpa_163"></a>I hope that the new arrangements for prosecutions will also help to close the tax gap. If prosecutions are more effective, that will encourage those who are evading or avoiding tax to pay their taxes, as all good citizens should, so that we have more to spend on essential public services. However, the staff cuts worry me.<a name = "41208-14_para6"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Kelvin Hopkins"--><a name="stpa_164"></a>I have some anecdotes of my experiences. Three or four years ago, I took it on myself to visit our local VAT inspectorate. I was impressed with what I saw. It was explained that had it got more staff, it could collect more revenue. The rough estimate was that every additional VAT inspector collected five or six times his salary in VAT every year. I wrote to Treasury Ministers,<br><br><a name="column_1202"></a><br><br>suggesting that we should have more inspectors because we could clearly bring in far more to the Exchequer than the cost of their salaries, which would be a good thing in every way. I got a bland reply, mentioning staff costs. I am afraid that I did not get a positive response.<a name = "41208-14_para7"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Kelvin Hopkins"--><a name="stpa_165"></a>I also took it on myself a little while ago to visit customs officers at Luton airport. Again, the same story. They were doing a good job of catching people who were involved in smuggling drugs in particular. They wanted more staff so that they could do an effective job because they were stretched. Again, I wrote off, saying the same thing.<a name = "41208-14_para8"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Kelvin Hopkins"--><a name="stpa_166"></a>PCS members and officers tell me that the same is true of personal and business taxation. With more tax officers specialising in those fields, they could collect more revenue, at a multiple of their salaries, so more staff rather than less would be good. It may be that other staff who are not inspectors and who are not directly concerned with tax collection could have their jobs modernised with IT systems or whatever, but inspectors can collect many times their own salaries. I ask my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to give that serious thought.<a name = "41208-14_para9"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Kelvin Hopkins"--><a name="stpa_167"></a>I also had the experience—again, this is an anecdote, although I am sure the experience is not uncommon—of returning from the continent 15 years ago. As one does when returning from holiday in France, I had a certain amount of wine in my car.<a name="st_71"></a>

There was no one present at the red line, so I got out of my car and had to walk a considerable distance. I looked about 20 ft upwards to find the only customs officer on duty, who was waving people through the green line. I said, "Excuse me." He said, "What do you want?" I said, "I would like to pay my duty, please. I have a certain amount of wine above the limit." The officer was astonished. I had written out what I had bought and where I had bought it.

My impression was that one man had been left at the port all night to wave the people through the green route. I am sure that things are better now than they were then.

I have never found any fault with the Inland Revenue. I only wish that my ability to complete my tax form was half as good as the Inland RevenueSSSQQQs in checking it. Customs and Excise does a splendid job. It is vital to ensure that the Government get their revenue, which they can spend on public services and salaries for all our public servants.

The failure to bridge the gap means that there is effectively a culture of petty criminality among people who are finding ways of avoiding or evading paying tax. That is particularly the case when importing cigarettes, other forms of tobacco and alcohol from the continent of Europe. That is not a good thing. We are a law-abiding society and I think that people like to obey the law. If we fail to police the taxation system and Customs and Excise properly, over time, we will allow that culture of petty criminality to develop.<a name = "41208-14_para14"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Hopkins"--><a name="stpa_172"></a>Allowing vast amounts of tobacco and alcohol to enter the country, illegally or legally at cheaper prices than would be charged in the UK, runs counter to the GovernmentSSSQQQs public health agenda. We should maintain the price of cigarettes and, I suggest, alcohol at the levels that we think are appropriate in Britain. That is a way of constraining people from excessive consumption. We think that the continent has got it wrong—I do, anyway. If it is serious about dealing with alcohol and smoking, it should introduce higher prices. Alcohol prices, as a proportion of disposable income, are now half what they were in the 1970s. Floods of alcohol are coming in from the continent that are not effectively policed or constrained.<a name = "41208-14_para15"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Hopkins"--><a name="stpa_173"></a>The money that is lost by failing to collect duties and taxes on those items is of fundamental importance to the Government.

I hope that the Government will take the point seriously. I hope also that the Bill will make a big difference in closing this tax gap. I hope that the Government will not use the measure only as a means of cutting the numbers of civil servants in the Departments, especially as the civil servants that we are talking about, above all, are the ones who collect money. They do not spend money. Their salaries are as nothing compared with the amount of money that they bring in. If we need more of them to collect more money to narrow the tax gap, we should<br><br><a name="column_1204"></a><br><br>appoint more of them.

They are people on whom we depend for the civilised society in which we live. It would be a mistake to push them into the profit-making sector. I hope that they will be kept as directly employed public servants and that they will continue to collect the £30 billion or £40 billion that we have heard about so that we can have more to spend on the health service, education and all the other fine public services.<a name="time_5"></a><a name = "41208-14_time1"></a>XZXZomit desc="time"YWYW3.6pmXZXZ/omitYWYW<a name="st_77"></a>

It has been put to the Treasury Sub-Committee. I am grateful for the kind words that have been said about the report of the Sub-Committee, which I have the honour to chair. The Committee, as my hon. Friend the Member for West Worcestershire (Sir Michael Spicer) reminded us, has been on this track for some time. It was in 1999, when he chaired the Committee, that it first recommended that a feasibility study should begin of the prospects of merging these two great and historic Departments. It was a year later, after taking evidence about other countries that had merged the two services successfully, and notably Canada, that the Sub-Committee made its final report in April 2000, recommending a full merger between the two Departments.<a name = "41208-15_para1"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Michael Fallon"--><a name="stpa_178"></a>That recommendation was rejected by the Government, as has been said. One of the things that puzzled the Sub-Committee when we came to consider the merger again was why the Government had changed their mind. It is important for the Government to declare why they have now accepted the recommendation.<a name = "41208-15_para2"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Michael Fallon"--><a name="stpa_179"></a>I was alarmed by the permanent secretarySSSQQQs reply when he was asked why he had changed his mind. He pointed to the record of other bits of Whitehall being merged. He pointed to the emergence of the Department for Work and Pensions. I do not think that it is<br><br><a name="column_1205"></a><br><br>necessarily the case that the functions carried out by that Department are demonstrably better carried out now than they were when they were distributed among other Departments.<a name = "41208-15_para3"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Michael Fallon"--><a name="stpa_180"></a>Secondly, the permanent secretary suggested that the creation of the Financial Services Authority, which had taken on the functions of a number of different regulators, had also encouraged the Government to think again. I am not sure about that parallel either. Regulators are much smaller than the bodies that we are now considering.<a name="st_78"></a>

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1205"--><a name="41208-15_spnew2"></a><b> Mr. Michael Fallon:</b><!--Mr. Michael Fallon--> My hon. Friend makes the point. We were surprised when we heard the announcement a year ago and it is worth trying to probe the Government on the reasons that they put forward. The evidence that we took from the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland pointed to a very different parallel. It said:<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a>"From past experience of the merger of the Inland Revenue and the Contributions Agency, the proposal to merge the Revenue and Customs does not inspire confidence."</ul><a name = "41208-15_para4"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Fallon"--><a name="stpa_181"></a>It pointed out that, five years on, those two bits of the Inland Revenue still cannot properly exchange information on their computer systems.

As I said, it is not enough to say that merging two departments like the ones covered by this Bill has worked with other departments or that the decision is simply strategic. In the business world, that would not justify a merger. I should remind the House of my business interests. One usually becomes involved in a merger in business because one can convince the board or shareholders that a merger will add value, reduce costs and make organisational sense.

First, they have said that they hope that the merger will improve taxpayer compliance to close the tax gap. Several colleagues have already mentioned that important point. Secondly, Ministers have said that the merger will reduce the cost of compliance and, thirdly, that it will reduce the costs of collection. If<br><br><a name="column_1206"></a><br><br>those are the three stated objectives behind the merger, we should, as my hon.

We pressed the permanent secretary and Mr. Varney hard on that point and, although it is hard to be sure, there appears to have been some attempt at quantifying the actual costs and benefits. However, that attempt seems to have been abandoned. We recommend in our report that such analysis should take place as soon as practicable. Even if we believe that the GovernmentSSSQQQs explanation that we cannot properly cost the savings until some of the second-order issues are resolved, we are still entitled to ask for the cost-benefit analysis to be carried out as soon as possible.<a name="st_82"></a>

It is still not clear where those savings will come from: whether they result from the 3,200 posts that will be scrapped directly, from the Gershon exercise or from a combination of the two. When the Economic Secretary winds up, I hope that he will be clearer with the House about the figure of £500 million. As the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) said, it seems a large figure if we are simply talking about the 3,200 posts. I am not clear whether it is a cumulative figure—the Government have previously counted things several times—or whether it is the actual figure that directly relates to the cost savings.<a name="st_84"></a>

Member for Luton, North raised the important issue of jobs, which is well documented in the PCSSSSQQQs submission to the Sub-Committee. We are told that, as part of the Gershon review, 12,800 full-time posts will be scrapped and that, as a result of the merger, 3,200 specific posts will be lost. That is a rather one-dimensional view of efficiency savings. When one asks Ministers and David Varney about the savings that will result from merging these two great departments, they respond only in terms of the number of posts to be scrapped.<a name = "41208-15_para13"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Fallon"--><a name="stpa_190"></a>As someone more distinguished in the Treasury keeps saying, it is not the job title that one holds but what one actually does that matters in government. It is not right simply to consider efficiency savings in terms of the number of jobs that will be scrapped. Instead, I would have expected to hear from the Government how the work load of the two departments, once merged, would be handled more efficiently.<a name = "41208-15_para14"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Fallon"--><a name="stpa_191"></a>I would have liked the Government to have responded much more vigorously on the whole issue of reducing the costs of compliance for business. If it is true that a merged customs and revenue service is going to result in reduced compliance costs for individual taxpayers or for business, I would have expected the Government to have set themselves more vigorous targets.<a name = "41208-15_para15"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Fallon"--><a name="stpa_192"></a>In an earlier Sub-Committee report, we said how impressed we were by the Finance Ministry in Holland in which officials have been set a specific target of reducing by 25 per cent. over four years the costs to business of complying with taxation. It has introduced modelling for the smallest businesses that enables it to measure the actual costs to small businesses, shopkeepers and medium-sized firms of filling in tax forms and of complying with the tax burden. Some 17 people in a unit in the Finance Ministry are dedicated to reducing the costs of compliance. I hope that Ministers will set the new service a much more specific target for reducing the costs of compliance for business.<a name = "41208-15_para16"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Fallon"--><a name="stpa_193"></a>I turn to the Bill itself, which is only the first of two Bills. I have two problems with that. Because the Bill is so minimalist, there is a risk, as the regulatory impact assessment pointed out, that its scope is inadequate. Because it is so minimal and has been introduced so quickly, it may not fully cover the arrangements that need to be put in place. I was alarmed to hear that we are to be faced with Government amendments to the Bill as<br><br><a name="column_1208"></a><br><br>soon as it starts in Committee. I very much hope that when choosing the two-stage minimalist approach, the Government have drafted the Bill correctly.<a name = "41208-15_para17"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Fallon"--><a name="stpa_194"></a>There does not appear to be a firm commitment to the second stage. The Department said:<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a>"More substantive change, and change requiring further legislation, will be considered as part of a longer term programme of work."</ul><a name = "41208-15_para18"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Fallon"--><a name="stpa_195"></a>That does not sound like an explicit commitment to a second-stage Bill, although I understood the Paymaster General to say earlier that there was a commitment to produce the second stage in 2006 or 2007. Perhaps the Economic Secretary could clarify that. It is worth some clarification, because we have some experience of two-stage reform. We are still waiting for the second stage of House of Lords reform, which still has not emerged some years after the first stage was introduced.<a name = "41208-15_para19"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Fallon"--><a name="stpa_196"></a>Secondly, there is the issue of powers. I welcome the non-transferability of powers to prevent any inadvertent widening of powers in the new department. That will need to be scrutinised in Committee. It reinforces the need for further legislation and for that to be forthcoming reasonably early, to ensure that the powers are appropriate, proportionate and fit for purpose. If the Government are committed to those tests—that the powers they are taking are to be appropriate, proportionate and fit for purpose—they need to get on with the consultation and get the new powers into statute as soon as possible.<a name = "41208-15_para20"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Fallon"--><a name="stpa_197"></a>One specific power that will concern anyone who scrutinises the Bill in detail is the power in clause 10 requiring officials to comply with<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a>"any directions of a general nature given to them by the Treasury."</ul><a name = "41208-15_para21"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Fallon"--><a name="stpa_198"></a>The explanatory notes are helpful. They state that that excludes directions on the day-to-day management of the service or on operational matters. The intention is fine, but the clause is not sufficiently tightly drafted. It might be helpful if the Government specified exactly what those<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a>"directions of a general nature"</ul><a name = "41208-15_para22"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Fallon"--><a name="stpa_199"></a>might cover. It might seem odd to ask for a general direction to be specified, but it would be helpful if we knew what kind of directions Ministers had in mind, given that the drafting of the clause is so wide.<a name = "41208-15_para23"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Fallon"--><a name="stpa_200"></a>I turn to confidentiality, on which I intervened on the Minister. That is a matter of concern to me and the rest of the Sub-Committee. We should always be concerned about confidentiality. I welcome the strength of the Paymaster GeneralSSSQQQs view this afternoon. A further reason for concern is that the departments are being merged into the Treasury building. That puts into sharp relief the question whether we can ensure that officials who are using the same building, sharing the same cafeteria and meeting in the same corridors are properly separated from the Ministers and special advisers who have the more political function.<a name = "41208-15_para24"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Fallon"--><a name="stpa_201"></a>Given that point, I hope that the Economic Secretary will clarify the downgrading of the oath and statutory declaration. We were told in evidence that it is no longer an oath but a statutory declaration. But, as my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) said, a statutory declaration made and witnessed at the beginning of each officialSSSQQQs employment has some solemnity about it and brings home to the person<br><br><a name="column_1209"></a><br><br>making the declaration just how serious the matter is. It is therefore not sufficient to write the terms of the declaration into the statute. How many officials taking up office will read the Act? Ministers ought to look again at that and reassure the House. If it is part of the employment contract of staff of the new department, there could still be a case for making that a statutory declaration in front of witnesses, as part of the employment contract. That may be MinistersSSSQQQ intention, but it was not clear from the remarks of the Paymaster General. I think that she appreciates the concern and I hope that the Economic Secretary will clarify the matter.<a name = "41208-15_para25"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Fallon"--><a name="stpa_202"></a>Finally, on the Bill, I turn to accountability. When we first heard about the merger a year or so ago, I expected that a single department would report to a single Minister. It now appears that the new merged department will report mainly to the Paymaster General, but also to the Economic Secretary on excise duties and green taxes, and to the Financial Secretary on stamp duty, taxes on savings and taxes on pensions. This is not a political point. The hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Beard) made the same point. It is cumbersome for a new single merged department to report to at least three Ministers. The Treasury Sub-Committee will want reassurance that the lines of accountability are not blurred and that everything possible is being done to narrow accountability to one particular Minister, who I expect to be the Paymaster General.<a name = "41208-15_para26"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Fallon"--><a name="stpa_203"></a>I shall touch on two other issues that are not directly referred to in the Bill, but that flow from the merger proposal. The first is the departmentSSSQQQs estate—the buildings that it will occupy. I make no apology for returning to the issue of Mapeley, which has preoccupied my Committee and the Public Accounts Committee over the past two or three years. Because the departments are being merged, the case for rationalising the estate and being clear about the costings of that estate is all the more obvious and important. That brings us back to the Mapeley costings. As the House may recall, the National Audit Office estimated that the facility price—in other words, the cost that the departments will pay Mapeley, the private sector consortium looking after the offices—should have averaged out at about £170 million a year over the 20 years from 2001. In a letter on 24 November, the Paymaster General told me that the payments to Mapeley in the first three years were £235 million in 2001–02, £306 million in 2002–03 and £311 million in 2003–04. Those payments were significantly higher than the NAO expected, and we must ask why. One would expect more rationalisation from a merger, and even after the Mapeley contract was signed—we will not go into the sad history of its offshore sourcing—one would have expected some variation to the contract to have been sought to reduce the number of offices occupied by the merged department.<a name = "41208-15_para27"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Fallon"--><a name="stpa_204"></a>In her letter, the Paymaster General explained why the NAO price of £170 million a year is nowhere near the £300 million a year that she now pays:<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a>"NAO modelling is based upon initial pre-contract modelling assumptions and as such would not be expected to capture changes in the profile of the estate due to new legislation or changes in the departmentsSSSQQQ business model."</ul><br><br><a name="column_1210"></a><br><br><a name = "41208-15_para28"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Fallon"--><a name="stpa_205"></a>Why not? The merger will provide the departmentSSSQQQs new business model and changes in the legislation.<a name = "41208-15_para29"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Fallon"--><a name="stpa_206"></a>One would have expected some rationalisation, but instead we have costs. I accept that the costs are for the first three years of a long contract, but they are now running at nearly twice the NAO assessment of the facilitySSSQQQs price. The point of putting offices under private sector management is to get away from the departmentSSSQQQs business modelling and forecasting and into the real world, where people experienced in estate management and commercial property can weigh up matters and make the required savings. In the private sector, such a merger would yield immediate savings by sharing offices, rationalising space and utilising fewer, not more, square feet. In other words, the price paid to Mapeley should be falling, not rising.<a name = "41208-15_para30"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Fallon"--><a name="stpa_207"></a>In the end, the Bill is about improving the service that the customer gets. In rather a chilling phrase, the Paymaster General said that she wants "to improve the taxpayer experience". Over the past few years, taxpayers have had much experience of paying more and more taxes. Taking her comment at face value, it is important to focus on the aim of the exercise, which is to improve the service to individual taxpayers and, indeed, business taxpayers. The record over the past few years is not particularly good.<a name = "41208-15_para31"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Fallon"--><a name="stpa_208"></a>The tax credit fiasco, on which my Sub-Committee reported, is not an encouraging precedent. The scandal of deficiency notices that are issued late or not at all again shows that the follow through is not particularly good when changes are made in Whitehall. Evidence is also emerging that the Revenue is not as good at running the benefits system as it was at running the tax system. We must focus on the service that the customer gets. From my experience of constituency casework, the Revenue and Customs must re-examine their interface with customers. For example, the helpline service is not nearly good enough and needs improving.<a name = "41208-15_para32"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Fallon"--><a name="stpa_209"></a>I am not sure whether people—perhaps even hon. Members—are sufficiently aware of the function of the adjudicator, who rules on complaints against the Revenue and its various sub-departments such as the valuation office. Last year, the adjudicator investigated 374 cases in the Inland Revenue and 98 cases in Customs and Excise, which is not an awful lot. We should use the opportunity presented by the merger to revamp the way in which the Revenue and Customs treat those who pay for them and rely on their services—the situation could and should be better.<a name = "41208-15_para33"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Fallon"--><a name="stpa_210"></a>Let me sum up. The merger was recommended by the Sub-Committee and is probably a good idea, but it needs to be driven by set objectives and against measurable benchmarks. I welcome this initial legislation and wish Mr. Varney and his team well in implementing it, but I put him, and Ministers, on notice that this is not the end of the story as far as the Treasury Sub-Committee is concerned. We will return to the merger at six-monthly intervals to see how it is getting on, because the stakes are very high indeed.<a name="time_6"></a><a name = "41208-15_time0"></a>XZXZomit desc="time"YWYW3.35pmXZXZ/omitYWYW<a name="st_86"></a>

Until now, it has been a classic example of something that lots of officials think a good idea, so it gets taken off the shelf, dusted down, put back, forgotten about and eventually taken back down again. I would be rather worried about an idea that Mr. Gladstone considered and rejected. We missed out some of the history, because Prime Minister H. H. Asquith had a nibble at it when he merged Customs and Excise.<a name = "41208-16_para3"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Atkinson"--><a name="stpa_214"></a>As my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) said, another unanswered question is whether the exercise is worth the candle. We will find out as the Bill progresses. I suspect that my hon. Friend was on to something when he suggested that the Chancellor wants to do this to set an example before he starts to lay about Government Departments. He could have triggered it through a series of timed statutory instruments; indeed, he could have postponed secondary legislation almost indefinitely. The merger is to proceed so incredibly slowly that it does not need to have a great deal of effect, but it enables him to say to other Ministers, "WeSSSQQQve put our house in order—now put yours in order."<a name = "41208-16_para4"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Atkinson"--><a name="stpa_215"></a>Another unresolved matter, which I hope will be resolved shortly in the winding-up speeches, concerns how many staff will be involved. The figure seemed to<br><br><a name="column_1212"></a><br><br>change almost daily between the ChancellorSSSQQQs first announcement in March and the evidence given to the Treasury Sub-Committee in October.<a name = "41208-16_para5"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Atkinson"--><a name="stpa_216"></a>Some years ago, the Conservative Government considered what to do about the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise. It was the subject of much discussion. One suggestion was that the Inland Revenue should merge not with Customs and Excise but with the then Department of Social Security. That option has not been considered. As the Inland Revenue increasingly becomes a tax and benefit-paying operation, it almost makes sense for it to be part of the Department for Work and Pensions rather than merging with Customs and Excise, which, as we have heard, has a different philosophy from the Revenue.<a name = "41208-16_para6"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Atkinson"--><a name="stpa_217"></a>The original Excise men were military figures, with their cutlasses and armed ships. Indeed, they chased the forebears of my constituents who had a readily available supply of illegal whisky stills in the Northumberland hills. The Excise men would wreck the stills. It was said that they were given a reward if they found a still, so when a still burned out, its owner would tell the Excise man who then "discovered" it and collected a reward. The distiller would receive half, which helped him to build a new still further up the hills. That was Northumbria a long time ago—but it is rightly said that the philosophy of the two departments differs greatly.<a name = "41208-16_para7"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Atkinson"--><a name="stpa_218"></a>Customs and Excise clearly has much more of a policing role. That is well set out in the various submissions to the Treasury Committee by the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, which is worried, probably rightly, about the gung-ho mentality that exists in the Customs service, as opposed to the gentler, more considered approach of the Inland Revenue. I know from experience of running a disorderly business—in its early days—that the VAT man was a sight tougher than the tax man. Anyone who fell behind with VAT payments had little leeway, whereas it was always possible to negotiate some settlement with the Inland Revenue. There are genuine concerns about the different attitudes.<a name = "41208-16_para8"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Atkinson"--><a name="stpa_219"></a>Let me comment on the problems that the Revenue experiences in paying the tax benefits. I am sure that all hon. Members have had constituency cases of overpayment of tax credits that are now being reclaimed, in some instances with a great lack of care for the victim. Obviously, some people must have realised that they had been overpaid, but others did not. They read the forms and thought that they were getting it approximately right. I have a constituent who received £150 in tax credits and has had the sum reduced to £30 a month. That has made a serious difference to her life. To echo my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks, it is almost impossible to get through to the helpline. My constituent came to me to circumvent the difficulty of contacting the helpline.<a name="st_91"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1212"--><a name="41208-16_spnew5"></a><b> Mr. James Gray  (North Wiltshire) (Con):</b><!--Mr. James Gray--> My hon. Friend is right. I have a constituent who is being asked for £7,500 that was wrongly paid to him, despite the fact that he phoned the Revenue on every occasion to check that the calculation had been done correctly. He was assured that it was correct until the final occasion, when he was told that a glitch in the computer system had<br><br><a name="column_1213"></a><br><br>resulted in an overpayment of £7,500.

The commissioners of the Revenue and of Customs and Excise are appointed by the Crown and are responsible to the Chancellor. Lord Bridges, the archetypal Sir Humphrey, when trying to examine the relationship between the Revenue, Customs and the Government, said:<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a>"The Inland Revenue and HM Customs and Excise are responsible to the Chancellor, and are subject to a measure of Treasury direction.

I hope that clear guidelines—there are already some—in relation to absolutely solid and enforceable duties of confidentiality will be provided for anyone who, under this Bill, has access to Revenue information As has been said, the Revenue has an enviable culture, and the vast majority of people do not want to break the law.

First, Mr. Justice Butterfield recommended that there should be regular refresher training for investigators, and secondly, that investigators should be subject to systematic external scrutiny. In Committee, we will examine these matters in some detail, and we will want to hear exactly what has happened since the Butterfield report, and on what standards of training the new department will insist.

I welcome the placing on a statutory footing of the new Revenue and Customs Prosecution Office, which will undertake all the new departmentSSSQQQs prosecutions. However, I am not entirely clear as to how it will be staffed, or how the varying expertise of the current Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise prosecutors will be melded.<a name = "41208-17_para16"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. David Ruffley"--><a name="stpa_245"></a>In 1999 and 2000, my hon. Friend the Member for West Worcestershire and I examined how the experience of the Canada Revenue Agency compared with ours, and we discovered that it was similar. To put it bluntly, the expertise of those in the revenue departments here and in Canada is of a higher quality than of those in the customs and excise departments. That is simply a cultural difference. Melding the two to achieve an optimal solution is what this is all about. However, the most recent Select Committee report—the proceedings were chaired by my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks—stated that<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a>"witnesses were concerned about the different approaches of the revenue departments and how this might impact on the new department."</ul><a name = "41208-17_para17"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. David Ruffley"--><a name="stpa_246"></a>Those concerns were summarised by the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, which said:<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a>"The Inland Revenue is more prepared to negotiate and has a more human face. By contrast, mention Customs investigators to accountants and businesspeople and exasperation sets in. Once the Revenue has made a ruling, it generally sticks to it. VAT offices change their minds more often—partly because they tend not to commit themselves in writing."</ul><a name = "41208-17_para18"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. David Ruffley"--><a name="stpa_247"></a>There is clearly a culture problem and I hope that, when the matter is put to bed, we adopt a pretty robust approach to change management. Ministers should adopt a hands-on approach to ensure that the execution of the merger takes the different cultures into account, but not use that as an excuse for things not going right. We need people to get thinking the right way and to do so quickly.<a name="st_95"></a>

Clearly, there are different kinds of powers and a different enforcement culture in the two departments pre-merger.<a name = "41208-18_para3"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Ruffley"--><a name="stpa_251"></a>For all those reasons, it is fair to say that this side of the House welcomes the merger in principle. Some of us have argued in favour of it for four or five years. We wait to see whether Ministers will clarify whether some of the savings that they talk about are Gershon savings or other savings. What are the medium-term savings and what are the short-term transitional costs? We look forward to greater clarification of those matters.<a name = "41208-18_para4"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Ruffley"--><a name="stpa_252"></a>Finally, we expect the Paymaster General to make two specific undertakings. First, she or her successors should not come back to the House with rather poor or lame explanations for why the IT has not worked. That will simply not be good enough. She and her officials must redouble their efforts, and not lapse into some alibi society as they did with the working tax credit computer model, when they said that they stress tested it, that everything was ready to go and that they simply could not understand why it was a dogSSSQQQs breakfast on the day it went live. No more excuses of that sort will be acceptable to the House.<a name = "41208-18_para5"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Ruffley"--><a name="stpa_253"></a>Secondly, in view of the different cultural mores of these organisations, new uniform management and working together will have to be forced through. We cannot allow excuses such as saying that organic change takes a long time. We want the merger to work and to work as soon as possible. I therefore give a qualified welcome to the Bill on Second Reading.<a name="time_9"></a><a name = "41208-18_time0"></a>XZXZomit desc="time"YWYW4.9pmXZXZ/omitYWYW<a name="st_97"></a>

I had a constituency engagement, the Ealing Family Housing Association annual pensionersSSSQQQ Christmas dinner. When they reached the Christmas carols, particularly "Oh Come, All Ye Faithful", I thought that it was time to come to the Chamber.<a name = "41208-18_para6"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="John McDonnell"--><a name="stpa_254"></a>Normally, out of politeness to the House, I would not intervene in a debate that I joined so late. However, I do not appear at risk of being trampled to death by other Labour Members wishing to speak so, in my capacity as chair of the Public and Commercial Services Union all-party parliamentary group, I shall make some comments about staffing matters.<a name = "41208-18_para7"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="John McDonnell"--><a name="stpa_255"></a>I want to begin with a general point about how legislation is considered these days, and what information is provided to the House in connection with staffing and manpower issues. Over recent years, the consideration of Bills has been refined. The explanatory notes accompanying a Bill now contain detailed assurances in respect of costs and compliance with human rights legislation. They also refer to staffing implications—that is, the impact on public service manpower.<a name = "41208-18_para8"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="John McDonnell"--><a name="stpa_256"></a>That information enables the House to try and identify individual costs and, in some cases, potential savings, but the system gives us a minimum amount of information about manpower issues. The one sentence<br><br><a name="column_1219"></a><br><br>on the topic in the explanatory notes for this Bill states:<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a>"There will be a net reduction of approximately 3,200 posts as a direct result of the integration."</ul><a name = "41208-18_para9"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="John McDonnell"--><a name="stpa_257"></a>Admittedly, the Treasury Committee looked in more detail at the staffing reductions consequent to the Bill, but even then the information provided was fairly peremptory. It identified that about 3,000 jobs would be cut as a result of this Bill, in the context of the other staffing reductions that were taking place. About 8,000 jobs will go as a result of the Gershon review and other studies, but the losses implied by the Bill will bring the total of jobs lost in the relevant departments to something like 12,500.<a name = "41208-18_para10"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="John McDonnell"--><a name="stpa_258"></a>Elsewhere in the public and private sectors when departments are rationalised and merged on such a scale, or when an organisation is reviewed or restructured, it would be expected that some significant detail about the new staffing levels would be made available. In addition, matters to do with staff structures would be covered in a report from the human relations department involved—what used to be called the personnel department—setting out the range of posts that would be lost, and the responsibilities that rested with those posts. Such a report would also outline the new structures being established, and possibly offer some detail about new posts and their functions. As a result, people could use that report to determine whether the new structures would be workable, in comparison with what had gone before.<a name = "41208-18_para11"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="John McDonnell"--><a name="stpa_259"></a>Interestingly, only a minimum amount of information on staffing implications has been provided with this proposal. More importantly, however, we know in some detail what went on before. The Treasury Committee has conducted many reviews and produced many reports over the years. Those studies have made it clear that both Customs and the Inland Revenue are world-class services. There is no doubt about their probity and the efficiency of their tax collection in many respects, but it is also clear that both services are open to innovation.<a name = "41208-18_para12"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="John McDonnell"--><a name="stpa_260"></a>I compliment the Government on their spend-to-save and spend-to-raise initiatives, which are proving exceptionally successful, and have enjoyed cross-party support. That success has been highlighted by the Treasury Committee.<a name = "41208-18_para13"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="John McDonnell"--><a name="stpa_261"></a>I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon), as the Treasury Sub-Committee has also been very frank about mistakes that have been made. That may have embarrassed the Government, but the Select Committee has a job to do and it has done it effectively. To be candid, it is clear that most failures in the past have not been blamed on staff at Customs and Excise or the Inland Revenue. To a certain extent, we as politicians have to take the blame for some of the failures, because some of the policies were wrong and certainly some of the initiatives that we thrust on the staff were ill thought through. At no time has the Treasury Committee made extensive criticisms of the staff and their professionalism. Indeed, the reverse is true: the Committee has been complimentary.<a name = "41208-18_para14"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="John McDonnell"--><a name="stpa_262"></a>If we know that the existing staffing structures and levels work effectively—indeed, provide a world-class service—we need to be careful when we seek to adjust, review, revise or change those structures. Anyone who has gone through a merger, in the public or private sector, will know what turbulence it can cause in an<br><br><a name="column_1220"></a><br><br>organisation. Mergers can lead to breakdowns in efficient delivery of services. My anxiety about the proposals is that it is almost impossible to judge from the information that we have been given about staffing whether the proposals will be effective.<a name="st_98"></a>

Gentleman was in his place earlier when the Paymaster General acknowledged that the reduction of 3,200 in staff numbers as a consequence of the merger was a guess—it does not come from a precise analysis but from examining how such mergers have been managed in the past. Does he think that it is sensible to produce such numbers, which are very sensitive for those people affected, in such a manner?<a name="st_99"></a>

Indeed, that was the flavour of the discussion in the Treasury Committee and it is contained in the report. At different times, we have had different figures. The overall number of staff savings has been a moveable feast, and that is an issue not only for this merger, but for Gershon.<a name = "41208-18_para15"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="John McDonnell"--><a name="stpa_263"></a>I have some anxiety about this proposal—not in principle, because the merger may prove to be successful. My concern is that if the merger takes place with a predicted number of more than 3,000 job cuts, without detailed information on how the organisation will work, posts may be cut that will be needed later. It might be that we rely on some of the Gershon proposals for savings, especially in relation to the introduction of information technology, but Members on both sides of the House will have their own views on our past performance on IT contracts.<a name = "41208-18_para16"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="John McDonnell"--><a name="stpa_264"></a>I am concerned that we may lose a large number of professional staff on whom we have relied in the past. We are about to create turbulence within departments that will reduce efficiency of service delivery. We may lose some professionalism in the process, at some cost to us all. That may all happen just at the time we need to collect more revenue because of the taxation gap that has been identified. Is that the time to introduce instability into the system? I would have thought that rather than pluck a figure for job reductions out of the air, which then becomes a target, it would be better to plan the merger, develop the staffing structures, and bring the information back to the House. We should plan for investment in staff rather than reductions in staff.<a name = "41208-18_para17"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="John McDonnell"--><a name="stpa_265"></a>The evidence that the PCS provided to the Treasury Committee set out the objectives of the service effectively and showed a real commitment on the part of staff to make the process work. However, I would not like to see the merger driven through on the back of staff cuts in a way that alienates a dedicated staff. Should we alienate our employees at the same time as launching what some have described as an attack—the Government call it a review—on other rights that they have had for a long time, especially their pensions?<a name = "41208-18_para18"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="John McDonnell"--><a name="stpa_266"></a>In the public sector, and in that particular part of it, we shall see the build up of a disgruntled staff who face job cuts and a review on reducing their pension<br><br><a name="column_1221"></a><br><br>entitlements, yet on whom we are putting an increased burden of tax collection due to the GovernmentSSSQQQs overall fiscal problem with the taxation gap. Instead of a successful merger, we shall have produced something that will be counter-productive to everything that we all want to achieve on the efficient delivery of service.<a name = "41208-18_para19"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="John McDonnell"--><a name="stpa_267"></a>I am especially concerned about the loss of expertise. A managed merger of this sort must be handled extremely carefully. When we have undertaken such exercises in the past—not just mergers but privatisations, too—we have found that it has taken, literally, a decade to overcome the loss of expertise. We debated the railway industry earlier this week. That is a classic example: the system was privatised, staff numbers were reduced and we lost the very experts on whom we should have relied to develop the new service we wanted to deliver.<a name = "41208-18_para20"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="John McDonnell"--><a name="stpa_268"></a>Staffing and personnel issues must be handled with incredible care. I cannot accept that blanket job cuts of 3,200 are rational at this stage, before we have even examined the merger and staffing structures in detail. At the end of the day, the cuts will prove counter-productive to the GovernmentSSSQQQs overall policy of increasing tax collection and tackling tax avoidance.<a name = "41208-18_para21"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="John McDonnell"--><a name="stpa_269"></a>Many Members have mentioned the tax credits experience. As constituency MPs, we all highlight the need for a human being at the end of a telephone to explain benefits and the taxation system, rather than some impersonal computerised system. If the Bill goes through, we are about to lose 3,200 human beings who are desperately needed to explain the system and support our constituents; we should not be putting them on the dole queue where they, too, will have to claim some form of tax credit.<a name = "41208-18_para22"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="John McDonnell"--><a name="stpa_270"></a>There is support for the Bill, but not for the proposed post reductions.

I had the impression then, which was right, that the Conservative party was the party of efficiency, which went for change and would look after public money carefully. From the financial point of view, it was probably the party that best served the interests of the community. On the other hand, there was no doubt that the Labour party was the party that cared for people and had more concern for them, and that influenced me. However, having listened to MPs over the years, there is no point in hiding the fact that what worries me now is the impression I have received<br><br><a name="column_1222"></a><br><br>from recent statements by Ministers, including the one we heard today, that the Labour party is forgetting its care for people.<a name = "41208-19_para2"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Sir Teddy Taylor"--><a name="stpa_273"></a>I live in Southend-on-Sea and meet many people who work there in one of the biggest Customs and Excise operations—our VAT office, which has a fine tradition—so, in all sincerity, I can tell the Paymaster General that I know many of those people. I go to church with them, I go to meetings and dinners with them and they are very worried indeed about their future. Will they have jobs? Is the organisation to be changed dramatically? Will there be transfers to other places? That is a particular concern in a place such as Southend-on-Sea, which has traditionally had more unemployment than elsewhere in Essex and the south. The Paymaster General is a courteous and decent person, so I ask her, please, to realise the extent of the worry and concern that those major changes are causing.<a name = "41208-19_para3"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Sir Teddy Taylor"--><a name="stpa_274"></a>My second basic point is that all the efficiency changes made by the Government are not working terribly well for people. The one big change that we had in Southend-on-Sea was the closure of our social security office and the transfer of the work to Jobcentre Plus or to the new pensions office in Norwich. I can assure the Paymaster General that, whereas pensioners used to like visiting the office in Victoria avenue to talk someone about their problems and to ask for help to fill in their forms, they now face the nonsensical situation of making contact with Norwich.<a name = "41208-19_para4"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Sir Teddy Taylor"--><a name="stpa_275"></a>If the Paymaster General would like to phone that number herself, she would find out about all the nonsense involved in being switched from one place to another and hearing a voice that tells people what to do. In addition, the system is subject to long delays. Bearing in mind the number of people who have come to my surgery—I hold a weekly surgery—that is a horrible state of affairs for the pensioners, because they are not getting the same service and they are very distressed about that.<a name = "41208-19_para5"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Sir Teddy Taylor"--><a name="stpa_276"></a>I hope that the Paymaster General appreciates that the VAT office is one of the major sources of employment in Southend-on-Sea. We have only two major employers: one is called KeyMed and the other, of course, is the department. When an earlier proposal was made to transfer the office to another place, it was accepted that Southend had such a long-standing unemployment problem that some special measures should be taken for us.<a name = "41208-19_para6"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Sir Teddy Taylor"--><a name="stpa_277"></a>What are we trying to do? Of course, it would be easy to say, "LetSSSQQQs scrap all these new plans and leave things as they are." That is difficult for the Conservative party, which works in the interests of efficiency. The Paymaster General should appreciate three things. First, it is desperately important that the local staff should be fully informed of what is happening, when it will happen and whether it will have a major impact on their employment. Secondly, facilities should be provided for meetings and discussions involving employees and trade unions. Frankly, unless that happens, people are simply being treated with contempt. Thirdly, the planned changes should take account of the fact that some areas have a tradition of high unemployment and special provision should be made for them.<br><br><a name="column_1223"></a><br><br><a name = "41208-19_para7"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Sir Teddy Taylor"--><a name="stpa_278"></a>Although I would in no way suggest that the Paymaster General is a difficult person or is being unkind, I hope that she appreciate that there is sometimes a danger of forgetting people in the rush for efficiency and change. I also hope that she will appreciate that the people who work in that office are very worried indeed and that they are simply looking for some assurances.<a name = "41208-19_para8"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Sir Teddy Taylor"--><a name="stpa_279"></a>This issue was raised by the Treasury Committee, as the Paymaster General will probably know, and page 7 of the report that was made available today refers to a man called Mr. Varney, who is a Mr. Big in the organisation. He was asked what will happen if the redundancies take place. He was also asked whether the 9,000, 10,000 or 12,500 proposed staff cuts—the figures vary—that result from spending review settlement will involve job losses. He replied that he could not rule out redundancies, but he would try to avoid them. Frankly, a married person buying a house with a mortgage, with two or three children at school, who is suddenly faced with the possibility of being made redundant does not have much to look forward to. If people are made redundant, I hope that the Government will go out of their way to try to ensure that they are offered advice about the alternatives or another form of employment.<a name = "41208-19_para9"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Sir Teddy Taylor"--><a name="stpa_280"></a>I can appreciate the GovernmentSSSQQQs desire to move towards greater efficiency, but as a local MP, I do not particularly like it because I found from the other changes that people previously benefited from personal contact with individuals and that they do not like the fact that they have to contact a remote office in Norwich and must do so by phone and by pressing buttons. That is not an improvement in the service for local people, so I hope that the Government will accept that such changes do not necessarily provide better services. In fact, because of all the problems with computers, people may get a worse service. The main thing is, however, that the people themselves do not think that it is better. They think that it is much worse. I hope the Government also realise that for those who face the possibility of redundancy is it frightening, horrible and cruel. I hope that they will go out of their way to reassure people, in particular those in areas of Southend, where this civil service work is a desperately important part of our local economy.<a name="time_11"></a><a name = "41208-19_time0"></a>XZXZomit desc="time"YWYW4.30pmXZXZ/omitYWYW<a name="st_101"></a>

We were also grateful for the whistle-stop tour, following the briefing, of the refurbished Treasury, but we resisted the temptation to pause and measure up the curtains. We felt that that might have appeared gauche.

The hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Beard), who served as a member of the Treasury Sub-Committee, spoke knowledgably on the subject. He provided us with some of the background to the proposed merger, including the genesis of the Butterfield report. We are grateful to him for adding that element to our deliberations.<a name = "41208-19_para13"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Mark Francois"--><a name="stpa_284"></a>The hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) spoke from the Liberal Democrat Front Bench. He, too, broadly welcomed the Bill, but like us expressed scepticism about the ability to generate material savings over the spending review period. There has been quite a lot of to and fro about that, so we would all welcome clarification of two things. First, what are the specific savings that the Department estimates will result from the merger itself? I am not talking about Gershon in the broader context, but how much public money will be saved as a result of the merger. Secondly, over what precise timetable do the Government expect those savings to be realised? In which year can we expect the full-year effect of those savings to have kicked in? If, for any reason, the Government cannot answer those two pertinent questions on Second Reading, they are in trouble from the word go. We look forward to the Economic Secretary clarifying those two points.<a name = "41208-19_para14"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Mark Francois"--><a name="stpa_285"></a>The hon. Member for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins) told us about discussions with his local trade unions relating to the merger, including during a recent visit to Luton airport. He amused the House with his valiant attempts to pay duty some years ago on his return from an enjoyable trip to France. As he mentioned consulting the unions, and as that sparked off a spat between the Paymaster General and the Liberal Democrats, perhaps the Economic Secretary will summarise what consultation has taken place with the unions to date, so that there is no confusion. Perhaps he could also say a few words about how the consultation process is likely to be taken forward with the trade unions as the merger rolls out. Given the comments that we have heard this evening, it seems that Members on both sides of the Chamber will be grateful for that clarification.<a name="st_102"></a>

On the basis of that work, he spoke knowledgeably about the proposed merger. He, too, argued for more specific information on the likely savings and how they are expected to be realised in practice.

If I heard him correctly, he also said that, over those 25 years, he never had cause to lodge a material complaint about the Inland Revenue. I am not certain whether all our constituents could provide such a blanket guarantee but I echo what my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester said from the Opposition Front Bench, which is that we pay tribute to the sometimes difficult work that members of the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise undertake. I emphasise that some of the criticisms that I shall come on to relate to their senior managers and to Ministers rather than to staff at the coal face who are doing the job from day to day.<a name="st_104"></a>

Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell), who raised the staffing implications of the merger. He made an important point on what is now becoming, in some respects, the impersonal nature of the system and the remoteness that many of our constituents feel when they have to deal with a call centre, especially when they cannot get through to the same person more than once. He introduced an important point and it is one to which I will return.<br><br><a name="column_1226"></a><br><br><a name = "41208-20_para5"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Francois"--><a name="stpa_291"></a>We also heard from my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East (Sir Teddy Taylor), who is my parliamentary neighbour. He raised particular concern about the staffing implications of the merger. I can well understand that because Customs and Excise has a major facility in Southend. I already know from our informal discussions that he has made representations on this matter on several occasions, as I believe has my hon. Friend the Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess). The issue affects Southend as a whole. The House will have heard what my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East said this evening on behalf of people in Southend. I hope that his points will be taken carefully into consideration as the merger proceeds.<a name = "41208-20_para6"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Francois"--><a name="stpa_292"></a>I also wish to refer to the remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley). He served with distinction on the Treasury Committee and was often a thorn in the side of Ministers. To a degree, he has achieved that in this debate. He spoke with particular force about the problems of information technology and how they cause difficulties for our constituents. I now turn to that subject.<a name = "41208-20_para7"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Francois"--><a name="stpa_293"></a>Given recent events, we have a strong concern about the risks that might arise from the IT aspects of the proposed merger. Between them, the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise have about 250 different legacy computer systems and deal with 13 million customers, including 3.75 million businesses of varying sizes and complexity. The departments already experience more than 250 million contacts a year, ranging from tax returns, letters and telephone calls to e-mails. The scale of the merger in IT terms alone is therefore huge, as is the potential risk to the GovernmentSSSQQQs revenue stream if it all went wrong.<a name = "41208-20_para8"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Francois"--><a name="stpa_294"></a>Unfortunately, even a brief examination of the GovernmentSSSQQQs track record in managing major IT programmes is very far from encouraging. There are already serious problems at the Inland Revenue itself even before the merger commences and several hon. Members have touched on that issue already. The Revenue is now responsible for the administration of the ChancellorSSSQQQs complicated system of tax credits. The computer system designed for that purpose has been exposed as being prone to error, including a particularly unhelpful tendency to overpay tax credits to people in one year and then try to claw them back in the next. My hon. Friend the Members for Hexham and for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) made that point.<a name = "41208-20_para9"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Francois"--><a name="stpa_295"></a>The Public Accounts Committee, which examined the performance of the Inland Revenue in this respect, came to a damning conclusion. In a press release of 22 April 2004, the CommitteeSSSQQQs Chairman, my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh), commented:<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a>"The problems that arose when the Inland Revenue introduced the New Tax Credits scheme are well known. It was nothing short of disastrous, with hundreds of thousands of claimants not paid on time, inevitable hardship for some, inconvenience to employers, and disruption to other parts of the RevenueSSSQQQs business. The Revenue should have been more realistic in setting the timetable and have put in place better contingency arrangements."</ul><a name = "41208-20_para10"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Francois"--><a name="stpa_296"></a>That is a sword of Damocles to hold over the GovernmentSSSQQQs head.<br><br><a name="column_1227"></a><br><br><a name = "41208-20_para11"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Francois"--><a name="stpa_297"></a>In facilitating the proposed merger, it will also be important to learn lessons from the recent problems—some of them very serious—at the Child Support Agency. By way of comparison, several years ago the Government decided to transfer CSA cases on to a new bespoke computer system known as CS2. The new computer cost almost £500 million of taxpayersSSSQQQ money but, according to an article on the BBC News website entitled appropriately, "Basically, it doesnSSSQQQt work", operators could be working on the system when it would suddenly lock them out without warning. It would take weeks before the case file could be electronically reactivated and properly dealt with. According to a briefing note from the Library, up to 150,000 cases are now stuck in the CSA system in this way and are effectively unable to proceed.<a name = "41208-20_para12"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Francois"--><a name="stpa_298"></a>Ministers are still wrestling with whether to try to fix the existing system or write off a great deal of public money and start again with an alternative. This has been a fiasco, and it led to the resignation of the chief executive of the CSA. Such events must be avoided in the merger that we are discussing, particularly as the merged entity would have to deal not just with individuals but with companies.<a name = "41208-20_para13"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Francois"--><a name="stpa_299"></a>It is important to remember that we are not just dealing with statistics, even though some of the numbers for the problem cases involved are very large. I say in all sincerity to the Economic Secretary that these are real people, many of whom rely on receiving money for which they have budgeted in all good faith, but which fails to reach them through no fault of theirs.<a name = "41208-20_para14"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Francois"--><a name="stpa_300"></a>Commenting on the syndrome of Government computer failures, the National Audit Office, in its November report on improving IT procurement, a copy of which I have, concluded that the failure of public sector IT contracts is due to a number of key factors, including a lack of a clear link between the project and the organisationSSSQQQs key priorities, a lack of effective engagement with stakeholders who will need to use the system, and a lack of clear senior management and ministerial ownership and leadership. That is a damning indictment from the NAO, in addition to the previous one from the PAC.<a name = "41208-20_para15"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Francois"--><a name="stpa_301"></a>As the merger is implemented, it will be important to try to avert what might be described as ordeal by Government call centre. Too many of our constituents experience a substandard service because the Government switch work into call centres backed up by inefficient or unreliable computer systems. The syndrome, which is all too familiar to many CSA and Inland Revenue tax credit customers, can be summarised as follows.<a name = "41208-20_para16"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Francois"--><a name="stpa_302"></a>The DepartmentSSSQQQs computer generates a letter that is incorrect on an account that was previously operating well. The aggrieved constituent telephones the number on the letter and is put through to a departmental call centre. After the electronic rendition of "Greensleeves" or whatever the music happens to be, they get the inevitable menu of options. Having fought their way through that, they are eventually put through to a member of staff. They give their reference number and the details, and attempt to explain the specifics of their case. That is all taken down and the caller is told something like, "I will send an e-mail to our computing department and have it sorted out for you. DonSSSQQQt worry."<br><br><a name="column_1228"></a><br><br><a name = "41208-20_para17"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Francois"--><a name="stpa_303"></a>Two or three weeks later the constituent receives another letter showing that nothing has happened and nothing has changed. Frustrated, they ring up the call centre again, are put through to a different person and go through the whole saga a second time, only to discover a fortnight or so later that again the problem has not been put right. The problems with tax credits and overpayments are a perfect example of the syndrome. Eventually, in a state of high dudgeon, the constituent arrives at their Member of ParliamentSSSQQQs constituency surgery to vent their wrath. I am sure a number of hon. Members have had that wonderful experience already.<a name="st_106"></a>

It concerns the machinery of government, but it matters to 30 million HMRC customers, including 4 million businesses around Britain. It enables the early steps in bringing together the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise—full integration is a long-term, large-scale undertaking. As my right hon. Friend said, the process goes beyond a simple merger between two departments.<a name = "41208-21_para4"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="John Healey"--><a name="stpa_308"></a>Between them, the two departments collect £400 billion in revenue each year. They pay out £17 billion in tax credits and a further £9 billion in child benefit, and they handle almost 40 million telephone contacts. The two departments employ 100,000 staff, operate from more than 300 locations, run 250 separate IT systems and carry out a wide range of functions from traditional tax gathering and assurance to enforcement of the minimum wage, payment of tax credits, facilitating British exports and securing the UKSSSQQQs frontiers. Between them, Customs and the Revenue have a proud history of more than 1,000 yearsSSSQQQ service to the British state and the British people.

Earlier this year, Gus OSSSQQQDonnell, the permanent secretary at the Treasury, produced the OSSSQQQDonnell report, which examined not only the case for integration but a couple of other options not involving integration. It set out the clearest conclusions on the case for integration, and I refer hon. Members on both sides of the House to page 6:<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a>"The case for organisational change rests on potential improvements in customer service, effectiveness and efficiency.

Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon), who led the work on the recent report, and<br><br><a name="column_1230"></a><br><br>to his colleagues, both past and present, who have contributed to this afternoonSSSQQQs debate. Last month, the Sub-Committee produced its report, which welcomed the decision to merge the two departments and reminded us, as the hon.

It endorsed what the Government saw as the pragmatic approach adopted in this initial Bill to create HMRC, which will be followed by further work. Finally, although this is not related to the Bill, the Committee endorsed steps to strengthen the TreasurySSSQQQs capability in the area of strategic tax policy making.<a name = "41208-21_para8"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="John Healey"--><a name="stpa_312"></a>In that respect, the Committee was reporting afresh on an issue that was first examined by one of its predecessor Committees in 1863, although that Committee published two reports that year which came to exactly opposite conclusions on amalgamation. The Committee chaired by the hon. Member for Sevenoaks has had no such second thoughts. Indeed, it made recommendations to the Government about proceeding on integration. It made further recommendations on quantifying the expected costs and benefits; on ensuring that business as usual is a top priority during the merger period; on proper parliamentary scrutiny, including a second stage of legislation for any substantive changes; and on safeguarding the confidentiality of taxpayer information. My right hon. Friend the Paymaster General explained that we have taken those recommendations into account in framing the Bill, and she set out the GovernmentSSSQQQs point-by-point response to them.<a name = "41208-21_para9"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="John Healey"--><a name="stpa_313"></a>I shall try to do justice to the very detailed contributions that hon. Members made to the debate, starting, if I may, with the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie). He said that as a country we are very lucky in our Revenue departments; we would share that sentiment. He said that he worked with both departments in the 1980s; I fear that he may have to wait for a little longer than a few months until he gets the chance to do so again. He mapped out the rationale for integration and quoted a section of the OSSSQQQDonnell review, which summarised the principal benefits on page 7 of its report.<a name="st_111"></a>

All did so in the context of being generally favourable to the plan to integrate the two departments. Essentially, their questions concerned detailed cost-benefit analysis of full integration. Let me try to explain the situation. A change management centre has been set up for the departments with the specific role of identifying and tracing the benefits that may flow from integration. As part of that, it will ensure that all proposals for bringing work together are tested to identify the benefits that they deliver and to establish proper priorities for the integration work. Of course, the National Audit Office will subject the new department to scrutiny and monitoring on efficiency and effectiveness, just as in the case of its predecessors; and any legislation on reforms that are required will be accompanied by a regulatory impact assessment that will spell out the anticipated costs and benefits.<a name = "41208-21_para11"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="John Healey"--><a name="stpa_315"></a>I remind the hon. Member for Chichester that, as my right hon. Friend the Paymaster General said, until this House gives the Bill its Second Reading, the departments do not have the legal authority to spend money to analyse and model the options in sufficient detail to quantify the costs and benefits that can flow from integration in the way that he seeks.

The costs of those posts plus the associated overheads could be approximately £100 million. That is part of a total saving, set at £507 million, that the department will achieve by the end of 2007–08. They are Gershon savings and include additional savings on posts through integration. Those efficiency savings will save at least £507 million by the end of 2007–08. Hon.

However, the Paymaster General admitted earlier that the figure was a guesstimate of savings. Is it appropriate to sign up to a target of 3,200 job reductions on the basis of a guesstimate?

There is nothing different about this stage of the process for HMRC.<a name="st_125"></a>

Member for<br><br><a name="column_1233"></a><br><br>Sevenoaks tried to argue. The statutory duty set out in clause 17 places the staff of HMRC under the same strict obligations as the Inland Revenue oath does, but in a modern guise. Protecting customer confidentiality will remain an essential characteristic of the new department, as my right hon. Friend the Paymaster General spelled out earlier, and all staff will continue to take their obligations on confidentiality extremely seriously.<a name="st_127"></a>

Member for Sevenoaks, for his work on this inquiry. It was a very productive inquiry: the fact that Customs and Excise and the Committee worked together was very good, and the fact that the Treasury has taken up our suggestion is very welcome. Confidentiality was a concern for us, however. Will the Minister assure us that he will ensure the confidentiality of each department, and that that will be in the Bill?<a name="st_128"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1233"--><a name="41208-22_spnew13"></a><b> John Healey:</b><!--John Healey--> I can give my right hon. Friend that assurance; it is indeed in the Bill.<a name="st_129"></a>

Member for Chichester raised the question of information technology, as did the hon. Members for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois) and for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley). The Paymaster General and I know only too well how central information and communications technology is to the delivery of the essential functions of both revenue departments. As we look forward to their integration and to the formation of HMRC, we are creating a single chief information office which will bring together the planning for both organisations. I want to make it clear that HMRC will not have a single operating environment. Both departments have many systems at present, a number of which are stand-alone systems that are likely to remain so under HMRC. As Members would expect, detailed contingency plans and disaster recovery arrangements are already in place, together with strategic sites for back-up. However, I do not accept the argument of the hon. Member for Chichester that it would be appropriate to publish that information.<a name = "41208-22_para3"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="John Healey"--><a name="stpa_319"></a>I am grateful to the hon. Member for Yeovil for his general support for the change that we are proposing. He says that he can see the potential benefits of<br><br><a name="column_1234"></a><br><br>integrating the departments, as we can, and he came to the same conclusion as the Treasury Committee that gains were more likely to come from integration than from the further closer working of the two independent departments. He outlined the three principal objectives involved: the further closing of the tax gaps; the provision of a better service to business and individual customers; and the efficiencies that can be gained. I say to him that the focus is certainly not only on the efficiency savings that could come from integration, although it is true to say that, on Budget day, when the integration was confirmed, the focus of the media was very much on those savings. The lengthy OSSSQQQDonnell report, the policy and plans in place in both departments to improve services to taxpayers, and the public service targets that are set for HMRC to continue to reduce tax gaps, will all, I hope, reassure him that this is not a merger that will be driven by efficiency savings alone.<a name="st_131"></a>

Friend the Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Beard), who has served for some time with distinction on the Treasury Committee, urged us not to lose sight of the wood for the trees. Like the hon. Member for Yeovil, he stressed the main concern, which should be to close the tax gap, as he put it, and reduce it almost to the point of elimination of evasion. I want to underline that HMRC has public service targets set throughout the current spending review period and throughout the period of the initial stages of integration, which cover reducing the amounts of unpaid VAT to the Exchequer and reducing the underpayment of direct taxes.<a name = "41208-23_para1"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="John Healey"--><a name="stpa_321"></a>My hon.

I am sure that he looks forward to the publication, which my right hon. Friend the Paymaster General mentioned, of the consultation paper on further steps and changes in powers in January. We look forward to his views and those of the Treasury Committee as part of that consultation. He was also concerned that integration should not distract the departments from their continuing duties. The Treasury Committee was right to<br><br><a name="column_1235"></a><br><br>stress that, and Ministers have made that clear to the new chairman, David Varney, who has certainly made it clear to his staff that that cannot be the case.<a name = "41208-23_para2"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="John Healey"--><a name="stpa_322"></a>The hon. Member for Sevenoaks asked why the Government have changed their mind since 2000, which was a point echoed by the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds. It is less that we have changed our mind than that we have undertaken a serious study, led by the permanent secretary to the Treasury, which gives us a better basis as Ministers to take such a decision to move to integration. It is also based on a couple more years of experience in government of such large-scale mergers than when the Committee first took evidence and produced its report. I welcome the second report from his Committee, as I have made clear, and its conclusions.<a name = "41208-23_para3"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="John Healey"--><a name="stpa_323"></a>The Committee urged us to treat this as a staged process, and to evolve the new department rather than to do it in one go, although, curiously, the hon. Members for Sevenoaks and for Hexham then started raising concerns about the second stage of the process. I hope that the former will be reassured by confirmation that the consultation on this second stage will begin in January, and that it is clear to him that we do not expect that to be completed in time for the setting up of the new department under this Bill. My right hon. Friend the Paymaster General has made it clear that we regard the Finance Bill in 2006, or appropriate legislation, as the likely timing for introduction of the succeeding stage. Of course, we will delay no longer than necessary, as to do so would be to delay gaining the benefits that we set out to achieve from integration.<a name = "41208-23_para4"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="John Healey"--><a name="stpa_324"></a>On the concern raised about geographic location and the move of Customs and Revenue staff to Parliament street—I will come on to the similar point made by the hon.

They will share those larger Government buildings with some HMRC staff and some staff from other Departments. However, the respective operational areas will be quite distinct.

Gentleman also asked about resources for the extension of the functions of the IPCC to the new HMRC. They are still being agreed, and for reasons that he will understand I cannot yet give him a definite answer. He asked about confidentiality, the principle of new powers, the quality and nature of investigatorsSSSQQQ training post-Butterfield and the external scrutiny that we deem necessary for<br><br><a name="column_1236"></a><br><br>investigators post-Butterfield.

He urged us to be prepared to invest in, among other things, more staff when there is a case for doing so, and my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) mentioned what he described as our "spend to raise" programmes. What we have done in the past has had an impact on the VAT gap, and helped to close the gap in the collection of tobacco excise duties. I was a little concerned when my hon. Friend was reciting his experiences at the port, until he explained that they had happened 15 years ago.

I should make it clear that, as the Treasury Committee advised and as Members have urged today, we cannot proceed without this legislation. The Bill legally establishes HMRC. It allows it to spend money in carrying out its functions, to deploy resources more flexibly on single visits and returns, and to pool information that Customs and Revenue officials currently cannot share. Although it is currently possible to achieve a good deal of close working and joint activity, a single Revenue department structure and management will indeed bring better strategic focus and benefits to all the departmentSSSQQQs customers.

That is sad, but it is also a matter of anger, however, because the means to keep his sight may be available but its use is being blocked by, of all people, the management of Moorfields Eye hospital.<a name = "41208-25_para6"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Norman Baker"--><a name="stpa_338"></a>Mr. Patrick suffers from a condition that is a form of uveitis, which essentially attacks the jelly between the eyeball and the retina, causing a disconnection. Although the erosion is gradual, the effect can be sudden. Such a disconnection can be triggered by something as simple as the individual who is affected bending his or her head in the shower. One eye has already gone, and the race must now be on to save Mr. PatrickSSSQQQs remaining eye. Such is his condition that he is already eligible for blind registration.<a name = "41208-25_para7"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Norman Baker"--><a name="stpa_339"></a>I want to run through the chronology of the key events. Mr. Patrick contacted me for the first time on 6 August 2003, when he told me that his consultant, Professor Susan Lightman at Moorfields had, since November 2002, wanted to prescribe for him a certain drug, infliximab, to try to help his eye condition but was being prevented from doing so. I wrote on that same day to the local PCT in Lewes—the Sussex Downs and Weald primary care trust—to raise the matter with it, based on the fact that the PCT had been contacted directly by Professor Lightman but had refused to fund the treatment.<a name = "41208-25_para8"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Norman Baker"--><a name="stpa_340"></a>The position that the PCT has taken—it is a difficult one for it—is, as I shall explain, to try to mediate between the different elements of Moorfields Eye hospital. In the response to me on 26 September 2003, the PCTSSSQQQs chief executive, Fiona Henniker, wrote:<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_81"></a>"It is not normal practice for a hospital doctor to approach a commissioner direct to ask for money above and beyond the sum already agreed in the service level agreement."</ul><a name = "41208-25_para9"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Norman Baker"--><a name="stpa_341"></a>So the PCT wanted approval from Moorfields direct, rather than simply an application from my constituentSSSQQQs consultant. I raise that issue now because it is relevant, as I shall explain later, in respect of a letter that I received from one of the MinisterSSSQQQs colleagues, Lord Warner, in considering this matter.<a name = "41208-25_para10"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Norman Baker"--><a name="stpa_342"></a>The PCTSSSQQQs position was not normal practice, and one of the questions that I want the Minister to clarify— I hope that he is able to do so—is the exact relationship between the three elements of the triangle in this sad saga: first, the PCT, the commissioning body in normal circumstances; secondly, the management at Moorfields hospital; and, thirdly, the consultant.<a name = "41208-25_para11"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Norman Baker"--><a name="stpa_343"></a>Is it possible for a consultant to secure funds from a PCT if the consultant believes that the release of those funds is appropriate and the PCT is happy to do so; or<br><br><a name="column_1245"></a><br><br>must the PCT always have approval from the management of the hospital where the consultant works? Despite a year and a half of looking into the case, I am still not entirely clear about the legal position in respect of that matter. If the Minister can clarify that in his remarks, I should be grateful. According to the PCT, Professor Lightman subsequently presented a protocol to the drugs committee at Moorfields on the use of the drug infliximab, but that was rejected.<a name = "41208-25_para12"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Norman Baker"--><a name="stpa_344"></a>The letter that Professor Susan Lightman wrote to the commissioning manager of my local PCT on 7 February 2003 is relevant to the history of the case. She gave evidence to the fact that infliximab helps uveitis and enclosed several abstracts which suggested that that was the case. So at an early stage, the consultant supplied evidence that the drug could be effective in dealing with the condition.<a name = "41208-25_para13"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Norman Baker"--><a name="stpa_345"></a>At the end of a long exchange of correspondence between Moorfields and my PCT, a reply was received from the Adur, Arun and Worthing PCT. My PCT had felt that it should not be deciding the matter and it had been referred to a specialist funding panel. In fact, there was a process error involving my PCT, which took some months to come to light, and that caused a further delay for my constituent.<a name = "41208-25_para14"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Norman Baker"--><a name="stpa_346"></a>The reply from the Adur, Arun and Worthing PCT, acting on behalf of my PCT, said:<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_82"></a>"My response to the request"—</ul><a name = "41208-25_para15"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Norman Baker"--><a name="stpa_347"></a>for funding—<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_83"></a>"is that we have a fully inclusive agreement with your Trust"—</ul><a name = "41208-25_para16"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Norman Baker"--><a name="stpa_348"></a>the Moorfields Eye hospital trust—<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_84"></a>"to cover the treatment of patients registered with Sussex GPs . . . It is therefore not appropriate for clinical departments to make direct approaches for additional funds.

It does not imply agreement or disagreement to the use of an unlicensed drug for your patient".</ul><a name = "41208-25_para17"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Norman Baker"--><a name="stpa_349"></a>In other words, both PCTs have taken the position that they do not want to intervene in whether the drug is used, but to leave it to the management at Moorfields to arrive at a conclusion with the consultant at Moorfields. I shall demonstrate that it has been impossible to reach such a conclusion because the consultant and management have been at variance throughout the process. In the meantime, of course, my constituent is going slowly blind.<a name = "41208-25_para18"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Norman Baker"--><a name="stpa_350"></a>I received a reply from Sussex Downs and Weald PCT to my next letter on 13 January 2004. It again reiterated its position. That letter, also from Fiona Henniker, stated:<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_85"></a>"This matter is very much an internal one for Moorfields NHS Trust. Unfortunately, Mr. Patrick is the subject of a difference of opinion within Moorfields NHS Trust about how new drugs should be introduced.

The problem appears to be the suitability or otherwise of the drug. The PCT quoted an extract from the letter that Moorfields sent to it, which stresses that the only issue is whether the drug is appropriate.<br><br><a name="column_1246"></a><br><br><a name = "41208-25_para21"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Norman Baker"--><a name="stpa_353"></a>However, the PCT conceded in the letter:<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_87"></a>"we do on occasions fund patients who are having unproven treatments, if we are satisfied that this will provide good quality evidence to help in the evaluation of a potential new service."</ul><a name = "41208-25_para22"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Norman Baker"--><a name="stpa_354"></a>So, first, the position appears to be that the PCT is prepared to fund "unproven" treatments and, secondly, there appears to be a situation in which the PCT would agree to fund a consultant, even if the consultantSSSQQQs own trust is not willing for that arrangement to take place. That is where the confusion lies. Again, it comes back to the triangular nature of the arrangements between the three participants—my PCT, the Moorfields trust and the consultant who works for that trust.<a name = "41208-25_para23"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Norman Baker"--><a name="stpa_355"></a>Given the uncertainty with the PCT, I wrote directly on 23 January to the chief executive of Moorfields Eye hospital, Mr. Ian Balmer. In my letter I included the following paragraph:<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_88"></a>"Can I ask you to set out exactly what the position is that you have reached, and if it is one which is contrary to the wishes of my constituent"—</ul><a name = "41208-25_para24"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Norman Baker"--><a name="stpa_356"></a>my constituent is happy to have this drug tried; he is aware of the potential side effects but he still wants to go ahead with it—<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_89"></a>"whether you would now reconsider this issue, given both his direct wish and the views of your own specialist?"</ul><a name = "41208-25_para25"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Norman Baker"--><a name="stpa_357"></a>I indicated in my letter the urgency because all the time it is possible that my constituent may go blind almost overnight, given the nature of the condition from which he suffers.<a name = "41208-25_para26"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Norman Baker"--><a name="stpa_358"></a>I am sorry to say that my letter did not engender the speedy and considered response from the chief executive for which I hoped. It was with some surprise that I had to indulge in a good deal of chasing up before I received a reply. I am disappointed by the laggardly way in which the chief executive appears to have dealt with the case and with my correspondence. I had to ring his office on 12 March to remind him that I had not had a reply. On 23 March, having had no reply to my earlier phone call a further 10 days back, I had to write to him again. I can assure the Minister that it is not the sort of letter that I normally write. I wrote:<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_90"></a>"If I have not received a reply within the next 7 days I shall be raising my constituentSSSQQQs case and your failure to respond to my letters both with the Health Minister and on the Floor of the House of Commons."</ul><a name = "41208-25_para27"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Norman Baker"--><a name="stpa_359"></a>That was sent after I had given Mr. Balmer two months to deal with the case of my constituent, who was about to go blind.<a name = "41208-25_para28"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Norman Baker"--><a name="stpa_360"></a>Having faxed that letter, there was a reply the same day.

It does not exist because the PCT has been unable to get one from Mr. Balmer and his management team, notwithstanding the wishes of the consultant. It is rather disingenuous to say that an agreement does not exist when he has been the person, as far as I can tell, who has prevented the agreement from being reached in the first place.<a name = "41208-25_para33"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Norman Baker"--><a name="stpa_365"></a>Most depressingly of all, Mr. Balmer writes:<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_94"></a>"I am afraid we cannot find a way forward for this particular patient at the moment".</ul><a name = "41208-25_para34"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Norman Baker"--><a name="stpa_366"></a>That is not exactly the sort of message that my constituent wants to hear from the chief executive of the Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS trust, the stated purpose of which, presumably, is to help people with eye conditions. It took Mr. Balmer two months to tell me that he could not find a way forward.<a name = "41208-25_para35"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Norman Baker"--><a name="stpa_367"></a>I then wrote to the Secretary of State about the matter. I explained the position and in quick time—far quicker than Moorfields Eye hospital—I received a speedy response from the MinisterSSSQQQs colleague, Lord Warner, on 21 April. Lord Warner, in his helpful letter, stated:<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_95"></a>"You may find it helpful to know that a hospital consultant can prescribe any product, including any unlicensed product, which they consider to be a drug necessary for the treatment of their patients under the NHS. When a patient is being treated at a hospital, the consultant can arrange for the supply of any drug, even one not normally available on NHS prescription, provided that the PCT or NHS Trust agree to supply it at NHS expense."</ul><a name = "41208-25_para36"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Norman Baker"--><a name="stpa_368"></a>That offers a wide remit to any consultant. Rightly the Minister continues:<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_96"></a>"GPs and hospital doctors are, of course, ultimately responsible for their own prescribing decisions".</ul><a name = "41208-25_para37"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Norman Baker"--><a name="stpa_369"></a>It is absolutely right that that should be the case. Lord Warner concludes:<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_97"></a>"It is therefore open to Mr. PatrickSSSQQQs consultant to prescribe Infliximab for him if it is considered safe and of therapeutic benefit."</ul><a name = "41208-25_para38"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Norman Baker"--><a name="stpa_370"></a>It is clear from Lord WarnerSSSQQQs letter that the decision should remain with the consultant. The consultant takes it on his or her head when taking a prescribing decision. That is subject only to the PCT or the NHS finding or funding the supply, and this drug is reasonably expensive. My constituent wonders whether that is an issue—everyone denies that it is—in his case.<a name = "41208-25_para39"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Norman Baker"--><a name="stpa_371"></a>According to the Minister and the Government, the consultant can supply<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_98"></a>"any product, including any unlicensed product which they consider to be a drug necessary for the treatment of their patients under the NHS".</ul><a name = "41208-25_para40"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Norman Baker"--><a name="stpa_372"></a>However, the NHS trust for which the consultant works will not supply it and the PCT in my area will not fund it because it does not want to cross the management at Moorfields. As the Minister will gather, we have a drug that the consultant wishes to prescribe, that my constituent wants to try and that, according to the Government, the consultant is empowered to prescribe under the NHS, but its prescribing has been blocked by the management at Moorfields Eye hospital, a body from which we might expect help for people with sight difficulties.<a name = "41208-25_para41"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Norman Baker"--><a name="stpa_373"></a>The Minister will realise that I have gone round the houses in an attempt to find a way forward, but each body appears to send the matter to someone else. I asked the PCT to reconsider its decision and, on 5 July, it<br><br><a name="column_1248"></a><br><br>wrote back to me. The PCT in my patch has been helpful and has done its best in a very difficult position between a rock and a hard place to find a way forward. I have no complaints about its approach. Its letter expressed its considered view and said:<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_99"></a>"We cannot, and would not, attempt to force Moorfields to prescribe a drug when their clinical governance body has decided that the evidence does not support its use."</ul><a name = "41208-25_para42"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Norman Baker"--><a name="stpa_374"></a>There we are. The PCT rebuts the idea that there may be any cost consideration and adds:<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_100"></a>"We have and will continue to be guided by Moorfields as to the appropriateness of this drug."</ul><a name = "41208-25_para43"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Norman Baker"--><a name="stpa_375"></a>That does not reflect Lord WarnerSSSQQQs view that the consultant could prescribe the drug and the PCT could fund it. The two positions are at odds.<a name = "41208-25_para44"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Norman Baker"--><a name="stpa_376"></a>We have moved on from November 2002 when my constituentSSSQQQs consultant first wanted the drug prescribed through to the middle of 2004 and we have got no further forward despite the consultantSSSQQQs determination to prescribe it. Professor Susan Lightman has set out her position in blunt language. For example in a letter to me of 3 December 2003, she said:<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_101"></a>"The letter from the Chief Executive is completely inaccurate and does not reflect the situation at all."</ul><a name = "41208-25_para45"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Norman Baker"--><a name="stpa_377"></a>She has been battling away for her patient as I hope that I am for my constituent.<a name = "41208-25_para46"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Norman Baker"--><a name="stpa_378"></a>Having reached this point, the next thing I did was to get back to Mr. Balmer, the person who had taken two months to reply to my letter and had done so only because I said that I might raise the matter in the House of Commons. After many phone calls, many attempts to find him and after ringing his secretary on a number of occasions, I finally got to speak to him on 23 July. He held to his position that it was not a matter of money, but of the "lack of any proof that the treatment works"—that is the phrase he used; I wrote it down at the time.<a name = "41208-25_para47"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Norman Baker"--><a name="stpa_379"></a>I said to Mr. Balmer that if he had genuine concerns about using an unlicensed product, his consultant did not and, with respect to Mr. Balmer, the consultant was a medical person and not a manager. However, if Mr. Balmer did not want to use the product, I asked him about his plan B. Without a plan B, my patient will go blind. No plan B is there from Mr. Balmer. As he had said:<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_102"></a>"I am afraid that we cannot offer a way forward for this particular patient at the moment".</ul><a name = "41208-25_para48"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Norman Baker"--><a name="stpa_380"></a>I asked him to make inquiries to find out whether there was any way that he would reconsider the decision of the Moorfields management to block its consultant from prescribing the drug. If that were not possible, I asked him to come back to tell me how he would help in another way to save the sight of my 31-year-old constituent. He promised to do so. Almost five months on, I am still waiting for a reply from Mr. Balmer, the chief executive of the trust. In case he has forgotten, I assure the House that we have telephoned him from my office on more than one occasion and asked him to ring me, but he has not done so.<a name = "41208-25_para49"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Norman Baker"--><a name="stpa_381"></a>Mr. Balmer has shown great discourtesy to my constituent, to a Member of Parliament, which is less important, and to the process whereby MPs represent their constituents. He has effectively written off my constituent and appears to be content to let him go<br><br><a name="column_1249"></a><br><br>blind—not a very happy analysis of a chief executive of a trust designed to help people with sight difficulties. If nothing else comes out of the debate, I hope the Minister will have inquiries made about why Mr. Balmer seems to be incapable of answering an MPSSSQQQs letters or phone calls about a constituent who is going blind. It is not good enough. Mr. Balmer should examine his conscience.<a name = "41208-25_para50"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Norman Baker"--><a name="stpa_382"></a>As regards the way forward, we are told that cost is not the issue. The arrangement with the PCT has been a red herring. I believe the PCT would be willing to fund the treatment if Moorfields management withdrew its objections. The issue is whether it is appropriate for the drug to be used for the particular condition. My constituentSSSQQQs consultant, Professor Susan Lightman, is in no doubt. She has provided me, the PCT and no doubt her own management with examples in which the drug has been used. She sent me, for example, an extract from the department of ophthalmology and visual sciences at QueenSSSQQQs medical centre, Nottingham. It is entitled "Infliximab in the treatment of refractory posterior uveitis" and begins:<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_103"></a>"Purpose: To determine the efficacy and safety of infliximab in the treatment of refractory posterior uveitis."</ul><a name = "41208-25_para51"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Norman Baker"--><a name="stpa_383"></a>In order not to delay the House unduly, I shall read only the conclusions:<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_104"></a>"Infliximab is effective in the treatment of sight-threatening refractory posterior uveitis. However, patients should be thoroughly screened for tuberculosis before treatment and followed up closely during and after therapy with infliximab."</ul><a name = "41208-25_para52"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Norman Baker"--><a name="stpa_384"></a>Professor Lightman also sent me an extract with the same title, "Infliximab in the Treatment of Refractory Posterior Uveitis" from the American Academy of Ophthalmology, which reported the following results:<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_105"></a>"Four of the 5 patients who were treated with infliximab responded to the therapy with resolution of uveitis within 6 weeks of the first dose and were able to discontinue all other immunosuppressive therapy. These 4 patients did not experience any adverse effects of infliximab."</ul><a name = "41208-25_para53"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Norman Baker"--><a name="stpa_385"></a>It worked for four out of five patients.<a name = "41208-25_para54"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Norman Baker"--><a name="stpa_386"></a>A young man with a promising career is going blind. He has already lost one eye and, because of his condition, could lose his other eye at any time. His professional consultant believes there is a possible way forward for him through the prescription of infliximab. She has demonstrated that it has been tested elsewhere, and the results that she has found suggest that it can be effective without, in the cases referred to, side effects.<a name = "41208-25_para55"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Norman Baker"--><a name="stpa_387"></a>There may well be side effects. My constituent accepts that, but he is young, he is going blind and he wants to try the treatment. His consultant wants to prescribe it for him and, in my view, he should be allowed to undertake that trial. He should be allowed the chance to save his sight. If he cannot save his sight in that way, what is plan B? It is not sufficient for the chief executive to say that nothing more can be done for this patient. I do not want to condemn my constituent to blindness when a possible solution is there, waiting for him. I hope that in his reply the Minister will give him some hope.<a name="time_15"></a><a name = "41208-25_time2"></a>XZXZomit desc="time"YWYW6.9pmXZXZ/omitYWYW<a name="st_159"></a>

Furthermore, I hope that he agrees that, in line with patient confidentiality, it would not be appropriate for me to comment in detail on the individual aspects of that particular case.

Gentleman raised several points about the handling of Mr. PatrickSSSQQQs case by Moorfields eye hospital and his local primary care trust. The first reason why my powers are limited is because the key trust involved, Moorfields eye hospital, is an NHS foundation trust. Foundation trusts are independent organisations that are no longer accountable to the Department of Health or to Ministers. Instead, they are accountable to four other groups and bodies: first, their members, via a board of governors; secondly, primary care trusts, for the delivery of NHS services; thirdly, Monitor, the independent body responsible for regulating foundation trusts; and fourthly, Parliament, which is responsible for the legislation that creates foundation trusts.<a name = "41208-26_para4"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stephen Ladyman"--><a name="stpa_392"></a>Because of foundation trustsSSSQQQ independent status and separate, local route of accountability, Ministers are no longer in a position to comment on or become involved in their day-to-day activities. We also have no powers of direction or intervention over those trusts. Freeing foundation trusts from the backstop of the Secretary of StateSSSQQQs powers of direction and Department of Health control means setting out and applying clear sets of rules for the regulation of foundation trusts and intervening only when things go wrong, which is the task of the foundation trust regulator, Monitor.<a name = "41208-26_para5"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stephen Ladyman"--><a name="stpa_393"></a>Monitor needs to ensure that foundation trusts are fully compliant at all times with their terms of authorisation—a sort of licence to operate—and the legislation, so that they deliver NHS services to NHS patients effectively, efficiently, economically and confidently. It has powers to intervene where necessary in the running of a foundation trust in the event of failings in its health care standards or other aspects of its activities that amount to a significant breach of the terms of its authorisation. That ensures that a foundation trust that is failing to meet its obligations can be brought back into line. Monitor will intervene only if it feels it necessary.<br><br><a name="column_1251"></a><br><br><a name = "41208-26_para6"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stephen Ladyman"--><a name="stpa_394"></a>In this particular case, I am aware that Monitor has considered Mr. PatrickSSSQQQs treatment, which it considers a matter for Moorfields eye hospital. That brings me to the specifics on the approval or non-approval of the treatment, and I stress that the issue does not concern funding. Instead, this is a case in which the PCT and the trust have not prescribed a drug because it is not licensed for that particular indication and because no new evidence exists to support its use. When a patient is treated at any hospital, whether or not that hospital is within a foundation trust, the consultant may prescribe any drug, including unlicensed medicines, as appropriate. That is what my noble Friend Lord Warner said in his letter to the hon. Gentleman. However, trusts have multi-disciplinary drugs and therapeutics committees that oversee the clinical and cost-effective use of medicines within their organisations, and all prescribing should have the support of that committee.<a name = "41208-26_para7"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stephen Ladyman"--><a name="stpa_395"></a>Of course, consultants are ultimately responsible for their own prescribing decisions. They should always satisfy themselves that the medicines that they consider appropriate for their patients can be safely prescribed, that patients are adequately monitored and that, where necessary, expert hospital supervision is available.<a name = "41208-26_para8"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stephen Ladyman"--><a name="stpa_396"></a>In March 2002, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence recommended the use of Infliximab for highly active rheumatoid arthritis in adults who have failed to respond to at least two standard drugs. However, Infliximab is not licensed in the UK for the eye condition that Mr. Patrick has and there is no sufficient or conclusive evidence to support its use for that condition, hence the decision taken by Moorfields.<a name = "41208-26_para9"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stephen Ladyman"--><a name="stpa_397"></a>A group of experts—the drugs and therapeutics committee—has decided that the potential harm to the patient from this treatment, including severe blood disorders and septicaemia, outweigh the unproven benefit for his condition at this time. I stress that the decision was taken by the drugs and therapeutics committee, which is a committee of experts, not a group of managers or people without expertise in such matters. Moorfields, as advised by its drugs and therapeutics committee, does not currently include this drug within its supported formulary.<a name = "41208-26_para10"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stephen Ladyman"--><a name="stpa_398"></a>If I might offer a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel, I am assured that the position could change as further evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of the drug in ophthalmic treatment becomes available. At the moment, however, the trustSSSQQQs position is that further research will need to be done before the clinical governance body will review the decision. I understand that the trust will continue to explore other possibilities that might help Mr. Patrick and other patients, including access to existing or future research trials.<a name = "41208-26_para11"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stephen Ladyman"--><a name="stpa_399"></a>As the hon. Gentleman spoke, I was struck by the length of time that this case has gone on. That might indicate that the clinical governance body last reviewed it before some of the evidence that he brought to the HouseSSSQQQs attention was available. One of the courses of action that could be taken, if it has not been done already, is for the consultant to put that body of evidence before the body and ask whether it considered it before making its decision.<br><br><a name="column_1252"></a><br><br><a name = "41208-26_para12"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stephen Ladyman"--><a name="stpa_400"></a>I understand that it was hoped that a research programme could be set up in the Moorfields area that might have been able to help Mr. Patrick, but unfortunately that has not happened.<a name = "41208-26_para13"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stephen Ladyman"--><a name="stpa_401"></a>The hon. Gentleman asked about the relationship between the trust and the primary care trust. Sussex Downs and Weald, the PCT that commissions services for residents, including Mr. Patrick, has considered the case. The PCT has a contract for specialist eye services with Moorfields, and general services are available locally. However, the specialist treatment that Mr. PatrickSSSQQQs consultant recommended is not supported by the trust, and therefore the PCT cannot fund it. I am assured by the PCT that, if different treatment options that were licensed for Mr. PatrickSSSQQQs condition were suggested, or if sufficient clinical evidence emerged to support the use of this unlicensed treatment, the PCT would consider funding. However, the PCT has made it clear that it cannot and would not attempt to force Moorfields to prescribe the drug when its clinical governance body has decided that the evidence does not support its use. The decision was not taken by accountants or managers, nor by the PCT. Like Moorfields, the PCT did not decide against the treatment for financial reasons.<a name = "41208-26_para14"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stephen Ladyman"--><a name="stpa_402"></a>Clinical governance is the collective responsibility of the clinicians at the hospital. Those clinicians have decided that the available evidence does not support the use of Infliximab in ophthalmology at the present time. The PCT has made it clear that it will continue to be guided by Moorfields as to the appropriateness of the drug as and when further clinical evidence is forthcoming.<a name = "41208-26_para15"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stephen Ladyman"--><a name="stpa_403"></a>If a drug is prescribed privately, the clinician will be bound by codes of clinical governance but will be held entirely responsible for the consequences if the clinician decides to prescribe it. But when, as in this case, a drug is prescribed or requested to be prescribed on the national health service, the NHS must share responsibility for the decision.<a name = "41208-26_para16"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stephen Ladyman"--><a name="stpa_404"></a>The rules for arriving at decisions about the drugs that can be prescribed, the validity of the evidence of efficacy and risk and the balance of the two are, therefore, agreed with the clinicians at the trust and they cannot be overturned by an individual clinician. Of course, that clinician has the opportunity to put forward reasons and make the case for the drug to be prescribed. The clinician has the opportunity to bring forward evidence that he or, in this case, she thinks has been overlooked and can even explore the opportunities for becoming involved in trials to establish that evidence. However, in the absence of that evidence, or having failed to establish a convincing case, the clinician cannot expect to have his or her personal judgement put in the place of that of his or her colleagues. He or she cannot try to make the case that everyone elseSSSQQQs judgment is flawed.<a name = "41208-26_para17"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stephen Ladyman"--><a name="stpa_405"></a>I assume that the consultant has based the view that the drug may help the hon. GentlemanSSSQQQs constituent on evidence. If it is strong enough to convince the consultant, it should also be strong enough—if the consultant puts the case—to convince the clinical governance committee. I therefore encourage the hon. Gentleman to speak to the consultant to ascertain whether new evidence, which the committee has not yet<br><br><a name="column_1253"></a><br><br>considered, has recently emerged, and to have another go at making the case. If the consultant can be convinced, so can the committee.<a name = "41208-26_para18"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stephen Ladyman"--><a name="stpa_406"></a>Politicians should not question the good faith of those who made the decision—that would be disingenuous to say the least—and claim that the decision must have been made on the ground of cost. The decision in the case that we are considering was not made on that ground, although I can understand why the hon. Gentleman is becoming angry with the trustSSSQQQs chief executive if he cannot even get information or responses to correspondence.<a name = "41208-26_para19"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stephen Ladyman"--><a name="stpa_407"></a>As I said earlier, I sympathise with the hon. GentlemanSSSQQQs constituent but I cannot and will not intervene. I certainly would not want anyone to see the decision changed until safety issues are resolved. However, if the hon. Gentleman and his constituent are dissatisfied with the answers that they have received from the trust, Mr. Patrick can, of course, complain to Moorfields about his treatment.<a name = "41208-26_para20"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stephen Ladyman"--><a name="stpa_408"></a>New regulations—the National Health Service (Complaints) Regulations 2004—came into force on 30 July this year. Although those regulations do not require foundation trusts to have a local complaints procedure, they will more than likely have their own process for addressing patientsSSSQQQ concerns. In any event, patients can complain to the Healthcare Commission and ultimately the health service ombudsman if they are unhappy with the treatment that they have received from a foundation trust. Mr. Patrick can also complain about the actions of the PCT if he wishes by first setting out his concerns to the PCT. If he remains unhappy, he can approach the Healthcare Commission and, ultimately, the health service ombudsman.<a name = "41208-26_para21"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stephen Ladyman"--><a name="stpa_409"></a>The hon. Gentleman said that he was satisfied with the efforts that the PCT had tried to make on his constituentSSSQQQs behalf and I am pleased to hear that. However, he is clearly far from satisfied with the efforts of Moorfields. I therefore strongly urge him to consider the complaints route and, if necessary, approach the Healthcare Commission. The chief executive reports to a board at the foundation trust. If the hon. Gentleman believes that the chief executive is not dealing with the issue appropriately, he might wish to approach members of the board and ask for the issue to be raised. The Healthcare Commission will make Monitor aware<br><br><a name="column_1254"></a><br><br>of all complaints that relate to foundation trusts. It will therefore be told of the matter if the hon. Gentleman pursues a complaint.<a name = "41208-26_para22"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stephen Ladyman"--><a name="stpa_410"></a>I hope that the matter reaches a satisfactory conclusion but I must stress again that it is for the NHS to resolve on the basis of evidence and expert clinical opinion. It is not a matter of money—it never was—and to suggest that that is the case is deeply unfair and, more important, will mislead Mr. Patrick and may indeed give him false hope.<a name="st_160"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1254"--><a name="41208-27_spnew0"></a><b> Norman Baker:</b><!--Norman Baker--> I accept that this is not a matter of money. I merely reported that my constituent was beginning to think that it might have been, given the apparent intransigence and the difficulty in securing an outcome.<a name="st_161"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1254"--><a name="41208-27_spnew1"></a><b> Dr. Stephen Ladyman:</b><!--Dr. Stephen Ladyman--> It is fair of the hon. Gentleman to say that. Let me stress that, following the inquiries that I have made in preparing for this debate, I have received assurances that this is not a matter of funding but of evidence. It is a question of getting evidence about efficacy in regard to the condition that Mr. Patrick is suffering from and evidence on safety issues. If that evidence can be presented, the decision can be further reviewed.<a name = "41208-27_para0"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Ladyman"--><a name="stpa_411"></a>I suggest that the hon. Gentleman and his constituent find out whether the consultant believes that all the latest evidence has been put to the governance committee so that it can reconsider the issue. I also suggest that they consider complaining about the matter to the Healthcare Commission, if the hon. Gentleman feels that that is the appropriate route to take, and to consider ensuring that members of the board of the foundation trust are aware of the issue and the way in which it has been handled, and of Mr. PatrickSSSQQQs dissatisfaction with the way in which it has been handled.<a name = "41208-27_para1"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Ladyman"--><a name="stpa_412"></a>I will ensure that the official record of this debate is passed to the chief executives of the primary care trust and of the Moorfields trust.
