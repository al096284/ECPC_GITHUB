<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1152"--><a name="60123-02_spnew11"></a><b> John Reid:</b><!--John Reid--> Our present deterrent is viable for about 15 to 20 years, so, as we made plain in our manifesto as recently as six months ago, we shall retain the nuclear deterrent for the foreseeable future. We shall do so on the assumption that, as long as anyone else who is a potential enemy has a nuclear weapon, we shall retain ours. That of course will have to be tested in analysis, with a forward look of between 20 and 50 years, if we are looking at a successor to our present system of nuclear deterrence; it is that very assumption that we will test against future threats and insecurities.

The debate will be about whether we should extend the minimum nuclear deterrent in this country beyond that period, so we are talking about analysing the threats and risks between 20 and 50 years hence. Once we have done that, if the same assumptions apply, if there is a possibility that a potential enemy of this country could have access to nuclear weapons, and if we retain the same assumptions that we have now, we would obviously retain a minimum nuclear deterrent.<a name="st_o34"></a>

It has resulted in great challenges for the TA and other reservists, but it has also resulted in great benefits.

It is probably true to say that most battalions are under strength when deployed and have to be strengthened by drawing in support from other battalions.

I oppose the amendment because, as the hon. Member for Ynys Môn (Albert Owen) has pointed out, the word "Senedd" translates, as probably everyone here knows, as "parliament". To suggest that the Welsh Assembly should be called the Welsh equivalent of "parliament" would add a lot of confusion. I would not have thought that that would be in the interests of Plaid Cymru, as it would suggest that a parliament exists, but at the<br><br><a name="column_1171"></a><br><br>moment we have only the Welsh Assembly. It would almost be a breach of the Trade Descriptions Act to describe the Welsh Assembly as a parliament. I and many of my colleagues would like it to remain a Welsh Assembly.

Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit Öpik) said in introducing this group of amendments that it was iconic. Basically, he and others believe that they should have a parliament for Wales, but the Government of Wales Act 1998 and this Bill do not create a parliament.<a name = "60123-07_para7"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Nick Ainger"--><a name="stpa_26"></a>The hon. Member for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale (David Mundell)—the name of his constituency is even longer than mine—made the point that there was an extensive debate on the term "Senedd" in the Committee on the Government of Wales Act 1998 and it was decided then that the title "Assembly" was appropriate. Although I understand the position taken by the hon. Members for Montgomeryshire and for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd), the Government and the Assembly are happy with the title "National Assembly for Wales". Several hon. Members referred to the risk of causing further confusion and the possibility that people would start to refer to the body as "parliament", which could cause it to be confused with this place.<a name = "60123-07_para8"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Nick Ainger"--><a name="stpa_27"></a>All hon. Members agree on the proposals in the Bill for the separation of the legislature and the Executive. One of the reasons why we need that separation is to give clarity to the devolution settlement in Wales—the public need to understand who is responsible for decisions. In putting that separation into effect, we are sticking with the terms that have gained common currency in the past four years: "the Assembly" and "the Wales Assembly Government". It has been argued that a new name for the Assembly would bring home to people the difference between the Government and the legislative body, but I do not believe that that argument is justified. The fact is that people have got used to calling the Assembly "the Assembly" and changing its name to "the Senedd" would only cause confusion.<br><br><a name="column_1172"></a><br><br><a name = "60123-07_para9"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Nick Ainger"--><a name="stpa_28"></a>Given that the hon.

We are not dealing with legislation for the next few years: it is likely that the decisions that we make today will be in force for decades and that the institution itself will exist for centuries. It is therefore appropriate that, six or seven years into the AssemblySSSQQQs life, we get the terminology right. There is a difference of view, but I am surprised that the hon. Members for Caerphilly (Mr. David) and for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies) think that people would be confused if "Senedd" meant a building as well as an institution. I presume that they are speaking from experience—that on at least one occasion the hon. Member for Monmouth got lost because both the building in which we are debating and the political institution of which we are a part are often referred to as "the British Parliament," but I have never got lost like that and I have never heard of other politicians doing so. More than anything, as the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) said, changing the name would create consistency between the bricks and mortar and the politics of Wales. Hon.

He is almost entirely duplicating the debate that took place in the first sitting in Committee on the previous Government of Wales Bill. As the Assembly grows and gradually acquires more power, is there any reason why it should not apply, under field 13 in schedule 5—part of the convoluted process put in place by the Government—to have control over the name of the Assembly and to amend its name in the future?

The point of the Bill is to give Wales what it deserves.

Part of that is changing the name of the Welsh Assembly to something more in keeping with what Scotland has. We think "Welsh Senedd" is the right phrase. I understand why the change of name would be resisted by those in the Chamber who are not minded to provide strategic parity with Scotland, but we are not making legislation for the next six years—we are making legislation that will outlive our political careers. We must therefore be a little more strategic than worrying that there will be a brief period of confusion, probably lasting months, and at the most lasting a few years, as people get used to the new name.<a name="st_42"></a>

As we pointed out briefly on Second Reading, the problem concerning the Assembly Measures procedure is that it is a way of getting around the necessity of holding a referendum to give primary legislative power to the Welsh Assembly. As we explained and is our view, while there may be arguments for or against giving primary legislative power to the Welsh Assembly, that is a matter for the people of Wales to determine if they so wish and a referendum is the essential precondition for doing that.<a name = "60123-09_para1"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Grieve"--><a name="stpa_36"></a>The problem of the route that appears to commend itself to the Government and that is contained in part 3 is that it envisages achieving roughly the same outcome by a mechanism that does not require a referendum and does not give primary legislative power to the Welsh Assembly. It allows the Welsh Assembly to enact Orders in Council, which are equivalent in scope to primary legislation.<br><br><a name="column_1178"></a><br><br><a name = "60123-09_para2"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Grieve"--><a name="stpa_37"></a>We exist in this House to scrutinise legislation. We may not do it as well as we should. Guillotines, lack of time and a host of other problems, some of them archaic procedure, do not lend themselves to our always doing it properly. Nevertheless, the process of a Bill—the process on which we are embarked this afternoon—is important. We are here not just to pass principles of legislation but, normally, to look at its detail. As most of us know, the process by which we examine the detail of legislation, if people are prepared to bother to come into the Chamber, sit, listen and participate, can improve legislation. The people who go up to the Committee corridors and listen to a Standing Committee are often pleasantly surprised to note the spirit in which the debate is conducted and sometimes the willingness of the Government to accept proposals.<a name="st_56"></a>

Throughout the procedure in part 3, it is the Secretary of State who will be exercising a form of tutelage over the way in which the Welsh Assembly carries out its functions. He has the power to block and to interfere and, in many cases, he will be able to exert influence because he can threaten to stop the procedure.<a name = "60123-09_para5"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Grieve"--><a name="stpa_40"></a>A further difficulty was explained to the House on Second Reading by the Under-Secretary, although I think that he got the procedure wrong.<a name="st_60"></a>

How is such a mechanism any less, or more, devolutionary than the GovernmentSSSQQQs proposal in part 3, which is not devolution, either? They are proposing to substitute government by primary legislation in respect of important laws with government by Order in Council. The Secretary of State seems not to understand that that is an assertion of Executive authority, not legislative authority. I fear that he has put together this proposal because he knows that he cannot satisfy either half of his party on the question of whether to proceed with the transfer of primary legislative functions and nor does he have a clue whether he would win a referendum.<i>[Interruption.]</i><a name = "60123-10_para0"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Grieve"--><a name="stpa_48"></a>The Secretary of State, having asked me a number of questions, is disappearing from the Chamber.

We have reservations about giving the Assembly more power, but we are absolutely clear that, if there is to be a transfer to it of primary legislative power, such a transfer should be put to the people of Wales in a referendum. If that is what they want, we will of course accept their view, because referendums are there for that precise purpose. What we are very worried about is part 3 of the Bill. As it stands, there will be no referendum in respect of part 3. There will be no formal consultation of the people of Wales whatsoever.

Indeed, we in this House have often criticised the system of governance by Order in Council for Northern Ireland.

What we will seek to do, therefore, is to see whether there are ways in which we can improve the working of the Assembly, either by granting the option, as the Secretary of State and the Minister want to do, of letting the Assembly have primary legislative powers, or by separating the executive from the legislature, which we entirely agree with.<a name="st_70"></a>

What is lost in part 3, as it is drafted, is our ability as Members of Parliament to serve the people of this country properly by carrying out our normal scrutiny role. I am prepared to go along with that, but only if we have the opportunity of looking at the end product as well as the proposal.<a name="st_86"></a>

May I put it to my hon. Friend that the mistake that the right hon. Gentleman has made is to regard himself, on the one hand, and Parliament, on the other, as synonymous? Surely if the interests of Parliament are to be protected and we have a choice as to whether the Secretary of State or the House is to do that, most of us would opt for the latter.<a name="st_87"></a>

There are some worrying aspects of part 3. I have a niggling feeling that it is only the beginning of a process that, one day, we will find foisted on people in England as well. Effectively, this Parliament will shed its responsibility for primary legislation except as a rubber stamp or stop mechanism. It will be said that it is so much better that such legislation is considered at a lower level with a wonderful dialogue taking place between the Executive and Assemblies that can be browbeaten. Scrutiny of such legislation can be dispensed with when, in fact, it has been our meat and drink for many centuries.

It might mean, for example, that an Assembly Measure could wrongly affect peopleSSSQQQs private interests and that, subsequent to it being overturned because of the invalidity of the process, there would be no redress for those individuals whatsoever. Is that the proper course of action for the House to adopt? Perhaps the Minister will be able to give me another explanation for why subsection (3) has been included in the Bill.

That is an extraordinary thing to do in part 3. It might be a proper thing to do in part 4 if we are handing over a tranche of responsibilities entirely, but doing that in part 3 is very odd.

Here is a brief chronology. The process started on 10 April 2002, when this House implemented legislation to reduce notice periods that must be given by local authorities and the police regarding the removal of abandoned vehicles. Some Members may recall having dealt with the substance of that debate.<a name = "60123-12_para2"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Llwyd"--><a name="stpa_68"></a>From April 2002 to February 2003, the Welsh Assembly Government lobbied the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to support the devolution of the relevant powers on reduction of notice periods and so on. In February 2003 there was a submission to the Minister in Cardiff for permission to seek DEFRASSSQQQs permission for a transfer of functions order and to consult Welsh stakeholders, which was then done.<br><br><a name="column_1187"></a><br><br><a name = "60123-12_para3"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Llwyd"--><a name="stpa_69"></a>In August, the Minister at DEFRA wrote to his opposite number in Cardiff agreeing to a transfer of functions order when convenient to the House of Commons timetable. That was because a suitable vehicle needed to be programmed into the Westminster process; it is not available on demand. In September it became clear that the abandoned vehicle powers would have to wait for a larger transfer of functions order. In March 2004 the Minister at the Wales Office wrote to the Minister in Cardiff that the powers would have to wait for the transfer of functions order relating to animal health later that year. That was to avoid Parliament being criticised for putting through a separate transfer of functions order.<a name = "60123-12_para4"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Llwyd"--><a name="stpa_70"></a>In July the National Assembly approved a draft transfer of functions order. In November it was passed by both Houses of Parliament. On 31 December it came into force, and a motion to delegate functions under the transfer of functions order was scheduled for discussion on 18 January 2005. That did not take place, for various operational reasons. Another motion to delegate under the transfer of functions order was rescheduled for 2 February. There were 11 explanatory notes and summary tables, which were e-mailed to Assembly Members at 2.12 on Thursday 27 January, at short notice.<a name = "60123-12_para5"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Llwyd"--><a name="stpa_71"></a>The story went on until November last year; and this was an uncontentious piece of legislation.

Gentleman has certainly offered us an impressive chronology of the events, but I put it to the hon. Gentleman, whom I hold in very high esteem, that he has deployed the tried and tested technique of invoking a worst-case scenario in support of his thesis. Every single week of the parliamentary year there are delegated legislation Committees after delegated legislation Committees considering a plethora of Orders in Council and statutory instruments, contentious and uncontentious, so the hurdle is not quite as great ordinarily as it could be and obviously was in an isolated but unrepresentative case.<a name="st_94"></a>

I was given this one by a colleague in the Assembly and it is probably on the bad side—otherwise I would not use it in my speech—but there are others and I am told that such matters take on average 18 or 20 months. A further procedure as proposed will of course add up to a considerably longer time.<a name="st_95"></a>

A Bill such as she proposes might be difficult, because it might deal with as many as 20 or 30 subjects.

The only reason why we have part 3 is that the Government have latched on to such a byzantine process in order to avoid asking the people of Wales in a referendum whether they want primary legislative powers.

There is a logic to us going through part 3 before part 4.

It seems to me that one of the essential safeguards needed in the process is that Members of this House have an opportunity at an early stage to make known their views on proposed Assembly Measures.

In recent years in this Parliament, legislation appropriate to Wales or directed at Wales alone has been drafted in the form of enabling legislation and has been passed either in a separate Bill or as a Wales-only section of a larger Bill. It seems to me that there has been little difficulty with those proposals being considered by Joint Committees, being drafted in the broadest terms in primary legislation and passed in those terms by this Parliament, and the Assembly implementing the proposals at a later stage, after its process has been gone through. It has not been necessary after the Assembly has gone through its process to bring legislation back to this place for a vote, as the official Opposition are suggesting should happen, and it would be unnecessary after the Bill was passed if Members of Parliament were closely involved at an early stage of the process.<a name="st_102"></a>

Now, we constantly pass legislation that gives wide discretion to Secretaries of State to enact secondary legislation, which the House has grossly insufficient opportunity to scrutinise adequately. That is a constitutional reform that I would very much like to see.<a name = "60123-13_para0"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Grieve"--><a name="stpa_75"></a>However, it remains the case that the House has a responsibility for primary legislation.

What he has ignored throughout all his comments so far in the debate is that<br><br><a name="column_1190"></a><br><br>the National Assembly for Wales is a democratically elected institution. The point of devolution was to introduce a more democratic element to the process of dealing with the huge number of distinct regulations that the Secretary of State for Wales dealt with in the past.

Does he agree also that the explanatory material that preceded that referendum made it clear that the powers to be devolved were secondary legislative powers, and that what is being proposed in part 3 is the piecemeal conference of primary powers on a step by step basis?

I do not regard the measure as the introduction of primary legislative powers by the back door. I do not support primary legislative powers for the Assembly. There has been an incremental process since the establishment of the National Assembly for Wales; for example, the introduction of Joint Committees, to which I referred. The Opposition did not at that stage call for a referendum. With respect to them, it is not possible for us to call for a referendum at each stage when procedures change. The correct time for a referendum to take place is when primary legislative powers are passed, if ever, to the Assembly. The present position is that the ultimate decisions will remain in this place.

Secondly, the point behind what he is saying is surely that there should be a referendum if significant extra powers are going to the Assembly. The Secretary of State for Wales and his colleague have already said that this is a significant Bill. Thirdly, the scrutiny process that can take place in the Assembly necessarily will be far more restricted because there are at most only 60 people whose input can go into that scrutiny, whereas in the House and the other place, as the hon.

The amendments could only have the unintended consequences that he states if, as a result of the passage of the Bill, the previous mechanism governing the AssemblySSSQQQs action disappeared, so that everything had to be an Assembly Measure. The Minister might tell me that that is how the Government have done it. If so, the House needs to debate that, because an Assembly Measure is different from the AssemblySSSQQQs previous powers. If that is one of the consequences of part 3, I find it slightly surprising that it was not highlighted by the Minister on Second Reading, because it would not only enhance the AssemblySSSQQQs existing powers but change them radically so that the Assembly could do something that it could not do previously.<a name="st_126"></a>

As the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) observed, that is a legitimate position, but my position is different.

It was pointed out that in Northern Ireland, in the absence of a functioning elected Assembly, direct rule must rely on Orders in Council.

The reply from the Government was effectively that it was a matter for the business managers. I am not convinced that it is. Obviously, business managers have an important role to play but the House has a right to look at how properly to scrutinise the legislation. There is a case for both the Assembly and Parliament meeting together in a Committee structure to look at that. There is a case for the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs to play a role in such legislation. In particular, there is a case seriously to question whether one and a half hoursSSSQQQ debate on Orders in Council is adequate. I am sure that it would be possible to extend that debate to three hours. I am sure that debates could be held on the Floor of the House if the issue were of such gravity, and that we can look at the role of the Welsh Grand Committee in these matters.

Such comment is right, but then it stops. The arrangements for the Assembly Government, or the Executive as it is likely to be called, and the British Government in terms of working out what happens with the Orders in Council are well defined in the Bill. Checks and balances exist, but there is a gap as far as this place is concerned. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and my hon. Friend the Minister would do well to return to the issue with colleagues, whether it be the Leader of the House or whoever, to consider again whether to establish formally in writing—in Standing Orders, in legislation or wherever—a system by which pre-legislative scrutiny is defined more closely and adequately, and Orders in Council themselves are not limited to one and a half hoursSSSQQQ debate upstairs in a Committee.

That might then help him to understand why part 3 represents a major shedding of power by this House, without referendum, to the Welsh Assembly, under the tutelage of the Secretary of State in its implementation.

It may be that there will be occasions when<br><br><a name="column_1201"></a><br><br>legislation will give the Assembly framework powers that it can convert into Assembly Measures, and I have quoted the Education Act 2005.

Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit Öpik) is no longer in his place.My right hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) touched on the importance of pre-legislative scrutiny in this process. The problem that we face is that the Bill cannot fetter the procedures of the House. We cannot dictate to the House the procedures for pre-legislative scrutiny. I agree with everything that my right hon. Friend and my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Ian Lucas) said about the importance of pre-legislative scrutiny.

We envisage that, with the agreement of the House and the Select Committee, a preliminary draft order will be produced by the Assembly after it has been through whatever processes it wants to go through, and that may include considering a report produced by one of its Committees. The Secretary of State would then ask the House and, in particular, the Select Committee to scrutinise that draft legislation or Order in Council.<a name = "60123-16_para5"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Nick Ainger"--><a name="stpa_102"></a>I hope that my right hon.

Instead of being a piece of primary legislation, the document shows how it would have followed the Order in Council and Welsh Assembly Measure system. The second relates to the Transport (Wales) Bill, which is completing its stages through the House. That would also have gone through the Order in Council process. Both documents clearly show the opportunities that exist for pre-legislative scrutiny.<a name="st_162"></a>

It would then be for the Assembly possibly to reconsider the form of the draft Order in Council, taking into account the pre-legislative scrutiny. The order would then return to the Secretary of State, who would lay it before the House, and it would be debated. If members of the Welsh Affairs Committee or anybody else who had been involved in the pre-legislative scrutiny felt that their reasonable comments and suggested amendments had not been taken on board, it is possible that they could persuade their colleagues in the House that the order should not go through.<a name="st_166"></a>

The hon. Member for Beaconsfield raised several points when he spoke to amendment No. 162, so it is worth putting our thinking on record. Amendment No. 162 would remove the protection afforded to an Assembly Measure against legal challenge on the ground of a procedural invalidity in the proceedings of the Assembly that led to its enactment. The Bill provides for the legal separation of the Assembly Government from the Assembly, as is the case here, in the Northern Ireland Assembly and in the Scottish Parliament.<a name = "60123-17_para3"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Nick Ainger"--><a name="stpa_106"></a>The Assembly should not be impeded in its primary function of making legislation by legal challenges, some of which could be wholly spurious and based on a technical invalidity during proceedings. In respect of Parliament, that principle is enshrined in article 9 of the Bill of Rights, which provides that freedom of speech, debates and proceedings in Parliament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place outside Parliament. It is also reflected in respect of the Scottish Parliament in section 28(5) of the Scotland Act 1998, and in respect of the Northern Ireland Assembly in section 5(5) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998. Clause 92(3) and the equivalent Measure in clause 106(3), which relates to Acts of the Assembly, will put the Assembly on the same footing as Parliament, the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Scottish Parliament.<a name="st_174"></a>

Our constitution is, of course, unwritten, and it has great flexibility. The right hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) made the point that constitutions evolve, which I acknowledge. I accept the MinisterSSSQQQs argument that the separation of primary and secondary legislation has a certain flexibility. In recent years, we have seen ample signs that the Executive have taken to addressing matters through secondary legislation that the House would have thought of as requiring primary legislation in the past. I also acknowledge that, as the right hon. Member for Torfaen said on Second Reading, the important aspect of scrutiny is its effect on the delivery of good governance and legislation to recipients. I thus hope that it is not the case that sacred notions of parliamentary propriety or historical ways of conducting business are simply embedded in my mind.

Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) about amendment No. 162 were telling. The reason why the protection that we have under the Bill of Rights was not given to the Welsh Assembly in 1998 was because it was considered that it was being set up not as a parliamentary body, but as a local government body. At the time at which we debated the matter, I highlighted my worry that, whereas the solution that we had adopted for Scotland was quite neat—one might have disagreed with it, but shedding a whole raft of areas of parliamentary responsibility to the Scottish Parliament had a neatness about it—the solution for Wales was fraught with problems because of the difficulty of separating primary and secondary legislative functions. That is embedded in my mind from all those years ago.<a name = "60123-17_para6"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Grieve"--><a name="stpa_109"></a>TodaySSSQQQs debate has highlighted the problem. Despite all the explanations that the Minister offered, we cannot escape the fact that the reason why the Government thought it necessary to give immunity to the Welsh Assembly was precisely because they intended to<br><br><a name="column_1205"></a><br><br>transfer primary legislative functions to it under part 3. I enjoy debating with the Minister—or any other hon. Member, for that matter—but when we are discussing constitutional measures, it is important that, while arguing our cases, we are honest with the electorate about what we are doing. The GovernmentSSSQQQs tendency to say that changes do not really matter because they are minor incremental moves, or gentle tweaks to the system about which we should not worry, is quite wrong. Even by the standards of the present blurred distinctions between primary and secondary legislation, the Government are presenting a fundamental, major constitutional change.<a name="st_179"></a>

On its own, the proposal before us would not be a substitute for the pre-legislative scrutiny. These things have to go hand in hand, but to suggest that the idea behind amendment No. 161 is an insult to the Assembly or the people of Wales is far off the mark.<a name="time_12"></a><a name = "60123-18_time0"></a>XZXZomit desc="time"YWYW6.15 pmXZXZ/omitYWYW<a name="st_183"></a>

Gentleman is saying that he wants to institute a system that would give the Assembly the latitude to make the tactical decisions within subject areas, but that he would like to maintain the strategic decision making in this Parliament, here in London. That is a legitimate position to hold, but he will understand that I have a different view, because I think it right to devolve the strategic decisions as well. Nevertheless, I understand his position, even if there is a genuine difference of view.<a name="st_184"></a>

You might not know, Sir Nicholas, that the Government issued a press release and the article that resulted from it was headed, "Hain accuses Tories of a bid to SSSQQQcastrateSSSQQQ Assembly". I have never been accused of trying to castrate anything, let alone an Assembly. I know that the Government are hidebound—they have got themselves into a Procrustean bed that they cannot get out of—but they will have to get used to the idea that the Opposition are trying hard to improve the position of the people of Wales. Through this group of amendments, we are trying to ensure that the people of Wales have a vote and a say in the matters that are before the Committee.<a name = "60123-19_para0"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mrs. Gillan"--><a name="stpa_122"></a>Clause 92 is the foundation stone of the new legislative architecture being constructed by the Government and it was debated in some detail in relation to the last group of amendments. It is the clause<br><br><a name="column_1212"></a><br><br>that confers on the Assembly the power to make a type of legislation in relation to Wales known as an Assembly Measure. In the previous debate, the Minister said that the clause provided "enhanced legislative powers". That means that the status quo will not remain and that the Assembly will have enhanced capabilities, over and above those that were originally envisaged. According to the explanatory notes,<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>"Measures will . . . have the same effect as an Act of Parliament."</ul><a name = "60123-19_para1"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mrs. Gillan"--><a name="stpa_123"></a>The notes continue:<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a>"they may modify the effect of legislation made or enacted before or after this Bill is enacted, or make entirely new provision."</ul><a name = "60123-19_para2"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mrs. Gillan"--><a name="stpa_124"></a>Under the clause, even if the process of enacting an Assembly Measure is invalid or irregular, that will not stop the Measure becoming law. That is set out in subsection (3).<a name = "60123-19_para3"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mrs. Gillan"--><a name="stpa_125"></a>Our amendments are designed to give the people of Wales a voice before that new, complex and—dare I suggest—cunning legislative device comes into force. Let me make it clear that we are not seeking a referendum because we believe that it would fail, or that it would succeed. We are keen to ensure that the Assembly develops in the way that the people of Wales want it to develop. Their wants and needs should be paramount.<a name="st_207"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1212"--><a name="60123-19_spnew1"></a><b> Mr. Philip Hollobone:</b><!--Mr. Philip Hollobone--> That is a crucial point. The National Assembly was set up after a referendum—albeit one whose result was extremely close—and any substantive changes to the way in which the Assembly operates should also be put to the people of Wales.<a name="st_208"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1212"--><a name="60123-19_spnew2"></a><b> Mrs. Cheryl Gillan:</b><!--Mrs. Cheryl Gillan--> My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. There is no doubt that if the people of Wales think that they are getting one thing when they are, in fact, getting another, it would be incorrect not to consult them or give them the opportunity to have a say on that specific matter.<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am being told by the hon. Member for Cardiff, West (Kevin Brennan) that they had a general election. There is no doubt that these matters were raised during the general election, but they were not raised in the detail that we now have before us in the Bill. It is only right that we have the opportunity to scrutinise the details, and if the Opposition genuinely conclude that the status quo has not been maintained and the caravan has moved on, it is only right that the people of Wales be taken along with it.<a name="st_209"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1212"--><a name="60123-19_spnew3"></a><b> Mr. John Gummer:</b><!--Mr. John Gummer--> Does my hon. Friend agree that that is especially true for those of us who are opposed to referendums in principle? If one has had a referendum on a particular constitutional base, one is then placed in great difficulty if the same mechanism is not used to ask when one wants to make a change. The Government are pretending not to be making a change in order to avoid that mechanism. Even those of us who hate referendums have to accept that the process is a continuation of one that, unfortunately, the Government forced through previously.<a name="st_210"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1212"--><a name="60123-20_spnew0"></a><b> Mrs. Cheryl Gillan:</b><!--Mrs. Cheryl Gillan--> I thank my right hon. Friend for that generous intervention, not least because I know that, in normal circumstances and on most matters, his face is set firmly against referendums.

In policy paper 3 the Government told the people that the Assembly would consider how new laws from the Westminster Parliament would be implemented in Wales, and that the Assembly would fill in the details of those laws by secondary legislation to reflect the needs in Wales. The policy paper answers those questions by saying that primary legislation will be made in Westminster, and that it effectively will be interpreted in Wales by the Assembly.

They said that the purpose of the referendum was to seek endorsement of the GovernmentSSSQQQs "detailed plans" that voters had accepted in principle. In other words, the last referendum was specifically on the detailed plans that were enacted in the Government of Wales Act 1998, and not on the general outline. The people were certainly neither consulted on, nor led to believe that they would get, the system that is before us today.<a name="st_221"></a>

The amendment would provide the opportunity for them to say what they would like and whether they approved of the detailed plans in the Bill.

These measures are therefore an indictment of the way in which the Secretary of State fights his corner in Cabinet for legislative time to be given to Wales. If that is the case, will a full list of every proposal that has been rejected by the Labour Government to date be placed before the House? I invite the Minister to place in the Library of both Houses a list of the requests that the Secretary of State and the Department have received from the Assembly that they have failed to satisfy. If we had that list before us, we would be better able to understand the position relating to the legislative timetable and the blockage to which everyone is alluding.<a name = "60123-21_para4"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mrs. Gillan"--><a name="stpa_143"></a>It is interesting that, while we are arguing about this in Westminster, the First Minister is arguing a different point in the Welsh Assembly. Last week, he stated that a "Westminster Department or two" would be able to get a Bill that they would not be able to get at the moment because of the lack of time in the parliamentary year. It is interesting that the Assembly should be pleading the case of Government Departments here, but I find it hard to believe that the parliamentary timetable is really so overcrowded, especially as the Government have now pulled their Northern Ireland on-the-runs legislation and appear to have pulled their legislation on the National Offender Management Service. They are also devoting six days on the Floor of the House to this Bill. I believe that there would have been plenty of time to accommodate not only the hard-done-by Westminster Departments so fondly defended by the First Minister but any outstanding requests from the Assembly.<a name = "60123-21_para5"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mrs. Gillan"--><a name="stpa_144"></a>However, the very fact that detailed scrutiny is to pass to the Assembly highlights the variation between the GovernmentSSSQQQs proposals and what the people of Wales have voted for. Such a change should receive their blessing or otherwise. Such a complicated process should not be put before the House when we could dispense with part 3 if we speeded up the process here and left in the Bill future legislative powers and the provision for the main referendum that has already been suggested. I believe that there is enough parliamentary time, and that this is really a question of business management.

In order to know what we would be putting to the people of Wales in a referendum, we should ensure that we have considered these proposals properly in this House and the other place. I was surprised to find that the proposals for the Assembly Measures had not been examined by the Procedure Committee in this House. I wrote to its Chairman on 11 January to ask the Committee to examine the implications of the legislative proposals in the Bill, so that it could give its view on parliamentary scrutiny for the procedures in both Houses. Before any<br><br><a name="column_1218"></a><br><br>matter is put to the people of Wales in any referendum, they should know the views of this House on the procedures that are being promulgated.<a name = "60123-21_para7"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mrs. Gillan"--><a name="stpa_146"></a>On Second Reading, the Secretary of State gave the impression that these matters had been discussed with Lord Holme and Lord Dahrendorf, the Chairmen, respectively, of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee and the Constitution Committee in another place, and that the Committees had been consulted. However, reading the letters from those Chairmen to the Secretary of State that have been placed in the Library of both Houses, it is obvious that neither the Committees nor the Chairmen had even seen the Bill, let alone had the opportunity to comment on it in any fashion. So perhaps the Minister could let us have sight of the response of the Secretary of State and tell us whether the Committees of this House and the other place will have the chance to examine these complex procedures, which were certainly not envisaged by the Richard commission. They would need to be examined to discover the full implications of what we would be putting to the people of Wales in a referendum. As Lord Richard suggested, as a very minimum, the Henry VIII powers ought to be considered, not least to see whether a more transparent and understandable method could be used than the tortuous route envisaged under the Order in Council mechanism.<a name="time_14"></a><a name = "60123-21_time0"></a>XZXZomit desc="time"YWYW7 pmXZXZ/omitYWYW<a name = "60123-21_para8"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mrs. Gillan"--><a name="stpa_147"></a>The Conservative party is committed to giving the Assembly the chance to work well. I do not want to rehearse the argument that we should allow it to improve its current performance before loading more competences on to its Members. As the Richard commission has said, however, given the complexity of devolved powers, knowing what the Assembly can and cannot do is becoming less of a problem for those close to Government, but it remains a central issue of accountability for the people of Wales. Perhaps it would therefore be more sensible to divide the Executive from the Assembly and look for a period of stability rather than load on another piece of complex legislative architecture. Were the Minister to dispense with part 3, maintain the status quo and consider improving the way in which the Welsh Assembly works currently—as it was envisaged working—perhaps we would withdraw the amendment, as there would be no need to insist on a referendum of the people of Wales.<a name = "60123-21_para9"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mrs. Gillan"--><a name="stpa_148"></a>I want to prevent an open-ended opportunity for repeated referendums should the initial result not be in accordance with the GovernmentSSSQQQs wishes.

As I have explained, we have proposed a referendum not because we would expect a negative reaction—I leave that to the Secretary of State and the First Minister—but simply to ensure that the Government are moving ahead at a speed that is acceptable to the people of Wales. Nor are we reluctant to see further powers given to the Assembly,<br><br><a name="column_1219"></a><br><br>which should only be done if it has the capability to exercise those powers and the full backing of the Welsh nation.<a name = "60123-21_para11"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mrs. Gillan"--><a name="stpa_150"></a>We have been disappointed by the progress made by the Assembly in its current tasks and would like to see it improve its performance before we spend more time saddling it with what must be one of the most complicated legislative procedures imaginable.

Whatever the arguments at the time might have been, that is the point that we have reached. The question that we are asked to discuss today is whether the change being made is sufficiently large to invalidate the decision made when the referendum was held, and to demand another referendum to ensure that the people of Wales wish to make such a step.<a name = "60123-22_para1"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Gummer"--><a name="stpa_153"></a>As the House will know, I am a disbeliever in referendums, which I consider to be a foreign and non-parliamentary activity. I would not have had a referendum in the first place—if the imperial Parliament, as it was once called, has decided to devolve its powers, that is a decision that the whole nation makes. That is not what happened, however. In this case, we established that a decision was reached as a result of a referendum. I have voted against referendums in every other circumstance, and I only think it possible to hold one in this case because of continuity with a previous decision that was made as a result of such a referendum.<a name = "60123-22_para2"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Gummer"--><a name="stpa_154"></a>Having said that, the Government are being peculiarly difficult in trying to pretend, on the one hand, that the changes are so minor that they do not require this reference to the people of Wales, and on the other, that they are too complicated for the people of Wales to make a decision. The Minister cannot have it both ways. The truth is that the changes are complicated because they are intended to hide the fact that they are so fundamental. The difficulty that the Minister must face is that I can find no parallel for this kind of legislative change outside of the desires of Napoleon III of France to avoid democracy.

The referendum is crucial in that regard. At least my constituents must know that the people of Wales want this. That will give them a start. They may ask for a change in the way in which things work here, but I think it very bad in todaySSSQQQs society to make changes in the constitution when there is uncertainty about whether they are wanted by those for whom they are being made.

They have produced a result that appears to give more powers, but in such a complicated way that the Minister is not even prepared to try to explain it to his electorate.

However, I urge the Committee to vote for the referendum not because I believe in referendums, but because I believe in keeping our word. In the last referendum, the word was that there would be a limited kind of devolution, different in nature from that provided for Scotland, and by a very small majority the proposal was passed.

The referendum was narrowly won, despite the fact that the Government spent vast amounts of money putting out one document after another purporting to show what a utopia Wales would be if and when the referendum were won. To some extent, they also encouraged people to vote in favour of the Assembly by deliberately holding the referendum one week after the referendum in Scotland. They were not prepared to risk Wales voting on the same day. Most important, they made it clear all along that the people of Wales would be voting on a Welsh Assembly, not a Parliament. Despite all that, they could only get a very narrow result in favour of a Welsh Assembly—the difference was about 2,000 votes.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1228"--><a name="60123-25_spnew0"></a><b> Mrs. Cheryl Gillan:</b><!--Mrs. Cheryl Gillan--> Nick Bourne went on to say that there are also divisions in the Labour party on this issue, as evidenced by voting on the Welsh Affairs Committee report, so the Minister should not be quite so keen to attack; rather, he should address the divisions in his own party. He asks how many people have asked for a referendum, but how many have been excitedly battering down his door and asking for this convoluted Orders-in-Council process? Where has the demand come from? If he can point to it, I should be delighted to read the references in the Libraries of both Houses. I do not believe that anybody has been demanding this process, except for the Labour Government.<a name="st_254"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1228"--><a name="60123-25_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Commissioner of Her MajestySSSQQQs Treasury Mr.   Nick Ainger:</b><!--Lord Commissioner of Her MajestySSSQQQs Treasury Mr.   Nick Ainger--> As I pointed out earlier, the three main political parties in Wales stood on manifestos that made it clear that they intended to give enhanced powers, in various forms, to the Assembly. If such demands had not come from those parties, why on earth would we have introduced this legislation? It stands to reason that there is demand in Wales for giving the Assembly enhanced powers, but Conservative Members seem not to want to accept that. The manifesto on which we fought the last election, and won, made it very clear that we intended to give the Assembly enhanced powers. However, the structure that we have provided means that Parliament will remain in control of deciding which powers we will give. That constitutes no significant change from the current settlement, so it does not warrant a referendum. I therefore urge colleagues to vote against the amendment.<a name="st_255"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1228"--><a name="60123-25_spnew2"></a><b> Mrs. Cheryl Gillan:</b><!--Mrs. Cheryl Gillan--> It was interesting to note that when the Minister began his response to this group of amendments, the first thing that he said was, "I am so glad that Members have managed to get that off their chest." Perhaps a lad from Sheffield cannot understand how passionately some Conservative Members feel about Wales, but they do. Indeed, that is perhaps the nub of this debate. The Labour party cannot stand the fact that the Conservatives have been listening to the people of Wales, are now representing them across the board—both in the Assembly and in this House—and want to speak up on their behalf.<a name = "60123-25_para0"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mrs. Gillan"--><a name="stpa_183"></a>We have had a good debate on this group of amendments. I do not agree with the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) on this issue; I would have expected him to support me, but I understand his position. I hope that he may support me on some other amendments because we do make common cause in certain instances. I am surprised that he does not support my proposed device, which would give the people of Wales a greater voice.<br><br><a name="column_1229"></a><br><br><a name = "60123-25_para1"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mrs. Gillan"--><a name="stpa_184"></a>I hope that people will take note of the honest contribution of my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer), who is fundamentally against referendums. None the less, he insists on voting to enable the people of Wales to have a voice through a referendum, because they were consulted on this issue in the first place and because the powers being granted reveal an almost Napoleonic tendency, as he described it. Indeed, given the power granted in clause 94(7)(b), the Secretary of State could almost be called Napoleon himself.<a name = "60123-25_para2"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mrs. Gillan"--><a name="stpa_185"></a>My hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies) also made a good speech. He pointed out that the Labour Government do not know where they are going or when they are going to get there. They certainly are not bothering to consult other people or take them with them down that road. My hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, West (Mr. Jones) also made a passionate and powerful speech, which was about protecting his constituents and the people of Wales in general.<a name="time_17"></a><a name = "60123-25_time0"></a>XZXZomit desc="time"YWYW7.45 pmXZXZ/omitYWYW<a name = "60123-25_para3"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mrs. Gillan"--><a name="stpa_186"></a>This is a complex and unique procedure that amounts to giving enhanced powers and making a fundamental change. So far as I can ascertain, the proposals in part 3 have not been scrutinised by Committees of this House in any detail, despite the Secretary of State trying to give us the opposite impression. This is not what the people of Wales voted for last time and, with respect to the Minister, it is not what they voted for at the general election. They did not have the opportunity to scrutinise the detailed proposals contained in this legislation, and they should have that opportunity. If their views were so important in the first instance, why is it right to disregard them now because of political convenience and expediency?<a name = "60123-25_para4"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mrs. Gillan"--><a name="stpa_187"></a>If this provision is supposed to be compensation for a lack of time for scrutiny, it constitutes bad management. We ought not to be legislating for such a convoluted constitutional procedure simply because we cannot get three measures through. We could have got three measures through in the time that has been allocated to discussing this Bill. We could have supported a truncated Bill, which could have gone through this House relatively quickly, had the Minister removed part 3, for example.<a name = "60123-25_para5"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mrs. Gillan"--><a name="stpa_188"></a>The Bill also diminishes the level of scrutiny in this House. We must remember that the people of Wales vote for MPs in this House not just from the Conservative party but from all other parties, including the Labour party. I notice that Labour Members for Wales have chosen not to contribute to this debate—they have chosen not to let us know whether they would like to grant their constituents the opportunity to have a say in this process.<a name = "60123-25_para6"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mrs. Gillan"--><a name="stpa_189"></a>This is not a transparent process. We are about to enact a procedure whereby Assembly Measures cannot be amended in this House. This is a very important and complicated procedure that will be able to pass, in all but name, primary legislative powers to the Assembly without the people of Wales realising what the Government are doing. Such a confidence trick is<br><br><a name="column_1230"></a><br><br>perhaps to be admired, but I do not admire it. The Government are pulling the wool over the eyes of the people of Wales. Therefore, I have no choice but to invite Members to join me in the Lobby tonight, if they believe that the people of Wales should have a voice. If, however, they believe that the Government know best and that Napoleon should get his way, they will of course vote against the amendment. But if they do, they will rue the day that they tried to silence the people of Wales in such an inappropriate fashion.<a name = "60123-25_para7"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mrs. Gillan"--><a

Clause 93 sets out the extent of the AssemblySSSQQQs powers to make Measures. It provides that the legislative competence of the Assembly can be altered by an Order in Council, thereby amending a matter in a field of schedule 5. However, subsection (2) of clause 93 states that if an Assembly Measure makes a provision outside the AssemblySSSQQQs legislative competence, it has no legal effect. Similarly, subsection (2) of clause 94 states that a field cannot be added to schedule 5 if it is one in which no functions are exercisable by Welsh Ministers, the First Minister or the Counsel General.<a name = "60123-32_para0"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Williams"--><a name="stpa_193"></a>In our opinion, that will limit the vital primary powers that we want, and that Scotland has already, over policing, administration of justice in magistrates courts and the Prison Service. Clause 93 and schedule 5 give the Assembly no powers over those important issues. Following the consultation on the future of police authorities in Wales, it was obvious that it was vital for the Assembly to have extra powers over the police. The consultation process was an absolute sham, because after three weeks we were told by the Secretary of State that there was only one option—a single police authority.<a name="st_452"></a>

Why has he set up the complicated system of fields in schedule 5, with further definitions in schedule 7? It would be much better to rule out those areas over which the Assembly has no competence. I know that the hon. Member for Clwyd, West (Mr. Jones) has been very concerned about that ad hoc method of adding primary legislative competencies to the Assembly. I would think that our proposal, as outlined in the new schedule, would give him more confidence that no additional powers could be devolved to the Assembly without a decision by this place.<a name="st_454"></a>

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1247"--><a name="60123-33_spnew3"></a><b> Stephen Williams:</b><!--Stephen Williams--> No, because as a party we have always made it clear that we believe in transferring primary powers to the Assembly. It was set up to improve the government of Wales and following a referendum that made it clear that secondary legislative powers would be given to the Assembly. However, it has become obvious to many, including to Nick Bourne, the leader of the Conservatives in the Welsh Assembly, that the present system is not working. To ask a body such as the Welsh Assembly to deliver services, including health and education, without having the necessary primary legislative powers is to put it in a position where it will fail to perform. Because it is failing to perform, it is losing the confidence of the Welsh people, and something needs to be done. Those people who value the future of Wales and of the Assembly are looking for ways in which to improve it and give the people of Wales more confidence that it has all the powers necessary to deliver first class services.<a name="st_456"></a>

Yes, we are suggesting that the Assembly should have power over the police, and it has been suggested for some time that it should have the power to determine the finances of the police authorities.

Gentleman made the case for giving the Assembly powers over the police and police authorities. As a point of principle, this Bill does not broaden devolution. That is not its purpose. It is here to deepen devolution. The issue of the police does not appear and I assure him that any further amendments looking to extend the areas over which the Assembly has Executive powers and legislative competence will not be considered.<a name = "60123-33_para3"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Nick Ainger"--><a name="stpa_197"></a>The hon. Gentleman asks why schedule 5 is set out in the way that it is and why the Bill is different from the Scotland Act 1998. In fact, the Bill is set out in the same way as the Scotland Act 1978. There are two ways of defining what an assembly or parliament has competence over. In the 1978 Act, it was decided, as we have decided, to define the areas over which it would be possible for the body to legislate. That is the first method. The other method was adopted in the Scotland Act 1998, which, as the hon. Member for Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr (Adam Price) rightly identified, the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire has done a cut-and-paste job on. I will not say any more about that. The second method defines the areas over which the body does not have competence and cannot legislate.<a name = "60123-33_para4"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Nick Ainger"--><a name="stpa_198"></a>A judgment is made based on other issues and relevant factors that would persuade one to choose one method over another. It is clear that we chose one system for Scotland in 1978 and another for Scotland in 1998. The issues are finely balanced. Wales is unlike Scotland and Northern Ireland because, in the other two Administrations, the areas over which they cannot legislate are defined. The other two have their own judicial systems, but the judicial system in Wales is, as we all know, linked to that in England. The jurisdiction is over England and Wales. As more and more legislation goes through, we think that there might be problems and that is one reason for choosing the option that we have.<a name = "60123-33_para5"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Nick Ainger"--><a name="stpa_199"></a>The option in the Bill also assists with the system for Orders in Council. The fields are set out in schedule 5 and, when Orders in Council go through, matters will be lodged under each field. That is an easy way to define the process.<a name="st_459"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1248"--><a name="60123-33_spnew7"></a><b> Mr. David Jones:</b><!--Mr. David Jones--> Of course, clause 94 provides that additional fields may be added to schedule 5.

Member for Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr (Adam Price) said, the Scotland Act 1998 refers to the courts. Clearly, we would require a large document not only to set out what was not devolved to the Assembly, but to take account of all the courts and judicial areas, including the Prison Service—the list would go on and on. It is far clearer for someone who is not versed in the intricacies of our constitution for us to set out in schedule 5 the exact areas on which the Assembly can legislate, rather than to produce a list of the things that it cannot do. A judgment must be made. For the reasons that I have given, we think that the approach represents a sensible way forward, principally because we are an England and Wales jurisdiction, so the situation is different from that in Northern Ireland and Scotland. When the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire considers the reasons that I have set out, their link with the Order-in-Council process and the way in which matters can be added so that the Assembly can take forward its Assembly Measures, I hope that he will withdraw the amendment.<a name="st_461"></a>

I am intrigued to understand exactly how the clause is designed to work and what the consequence of accepting the amendment would be. There is provision to allow Assembly Measures to be extended so that they cover consequential areas. Clause 93(5)(a) makes it clear that, in such circumstances, there must be the power to enforce the provision. However, the paragraph also refers to making the provision "effective". Quite simply, I wish to know from the Minister what that would entail. He will be aware that there is concern about whether it would be possible to extend such legislation to England, although I am mindful of the clear wording in an earlier subsection. I simply ask for reassurance about why the specific form of words has been chosen.<a name="st_464"></a>

If a question arises as to whether a provision in a Measure relates to a matter in schedule 5, the question is to be decided by considering the purpose of the Assembly Measure.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1251"--><a name="60123-34_spnew6"></a><b> Adam Price:</b><!--Adam Price--> If my hon. Friend the Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) appears in a second, he may want to say a few words about amendment No. 25, which is more his area of competence, although sadly at the moment not that of the National Assembly.<a name = "60123-34_para4"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Adam Price"--><a name="stpa_206"></a>On the Under-SecretarySSSQQQs suggestion, I will be pithy. Energy is topical at the moment with the publication today of the GovernmentSSSQQQs consultation paper and the energy review. As energy provision is such a vital function and a secure, diverse and sustainable supply is so important, the issue is clearly of vast interest across the nations, but there are particular interests and the nature of energy differs across the United Kingdom. Energy has of course played a very important part in the history of Wales; we have certainly produced enough of it for the rest of the UK over a couple of centuries at least. It remains a key political issue in Wales for a variety of reasons.<a name = "60123-34_para5"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Adam Price"--><a name="stpa_207"></a>However, there is an anomaly. Although energy remains a reserved matter, even under the Scotland Act, elements of it have been devolved and will be under the proposals in this Bill for Wales. Energy efficiency, for instance, is a devolved matter provided that it does not involve regulation or prohibition, as is energy conservation, and so on. Some elements of renewable energy are devolved and will continue to be so under the Bill. However, where there is interconnection, therein lies a problem.<a name = "60123-34_para6"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Adam Price"--><a name="stpa_208"></a>At the moment, projects under 50 MW onshore are devolved to the National Assembly, whereas projects bigger than that remain a reserved matter in the Department of Trade and Industry. We argue that that is not acceptable. If we are to have a comprehensive energy policy for Wales, we must have greater devolution of power. That is why we seek through this amendment to introduce a new field for energy, which will allow the National Assembly, following the enactment of this Bill, to propose Orders in Council, extending some of its competence in energy.<a name = "60123-34_para7"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Adam Price"--><a name="stpa_209"></a>Offshore developments are another area of increasing interest. There is an interesting feasibility study about possible tidal developments in Swansea bay and other coastal areas of Wales. Currently, and following the enactment of the Bill, such developments remain an exclusive power of the DTI. The Assembly should be enabled to propose an Order in Council to allow it greater control over such areas.<a name = "60123-34_para8"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Adam Price"--><a name="stpa_210"></a>Moving to the more contentious issue of nuclear power, the National Assembly for Wales should decide whether Wales sees the building of a nuclear power station. We have heard the Secretary of State for Wales<br><br><a name="column_1252"></a><br><br>express the view that he does not believe that Wales should go down the nuclear route, and similar statements have been made by the Minister for Economic Development and Transport who has responsibility for energy in the National Assembly. There is consensus among three, if not four, of the political parties—and, who knows, some of the independents as well—on the fact that we do not want Wales to go down such a route, but currently and under the Bill the National Assembly does not have the power to reject the imposition of a new nuclear power station, whether in Pembrokeshire, Carmarthenshire or any other part of Wales.<a name = "60123-34_para9"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Adam Price"--><a name="stpa_211"></a>Surely that cannot be right. The Scottish Executive have the power under the Electricity Act 1989 to award or to reject power station consents. All we are asking in the amendment is that the National Assembly have the right to propose an Order in Council giving itself the same power as the Executives in Scotland and, indeed, Northern Ireland have.<a name="st_476"></a>

Gentleman agree that if the Government are serious about having a genuine debate on nuclear power with the country, they should not be afraid to give the Welsh Assembly that authority? After all, it would be utterly undemocratic to force a nuclear power station on a community that clearly would resist such an application.<a name="st_477"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1252"--><a name="60123-34_spnew8"></a><b> Adam Price:</b><!--Adam Price--> I entirely agree. When the Government publish the results of the consultation, it will be interesting to see whether there are different responses in the constituent nations of the United Kingdom. It is a matter for England if England wants to go down the nuclear route, but I suspect that the response in Wales will be negative. As the leader of the Liberal Democrats in Wales says, Wales should have right to decide its own future, because we shall be binding future generations.<a name = "60123-34_para10"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Adam Price"--><a name="stpa_212"></a>I could go on to talk at length about other energy issues, but I am conscious of time. However, I should like to mention the energy corridor between the liquid natural gas terminals, which are themselves contentious, as the Under-Secretary knows. The proposed route of the pipeline goes through my constituency. That matter, too, is reserved; it is dealt with by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, although it cuts across planning and energy policy. Surely greater responsibility should be given to the National Assembly to enable it to produce a comprehensive energy policy that the people of Wales support.<a name="time_19"></a><a name = "60123-34_time0"></a>XZXZomit desc="time"YWYW8.30 pmXZXZ/omitYWYW<a name="st_478"></a>

I do not share the views of the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit Öpik) on the way in which energy provisions are working in Scotland. I have great concerns that nationalist elements in particular wish to use the difference between the powers that the Scottish Parliament has and the powers that the UK Parliament has to create a constitutional block and, if possible, crisis by presenting differences on energy policy. If the UK GovernmentSSSQQQs policy is to have nuclear power in the UK, it is not for the Scottish Executive and Scottish Parliament, using provisions relating to other matters, to attempt to block the GovernmentSSSQQQs energy policy. All such attempts to distort the devolution settlements should be resisted.<a name="st_479"></a>

We know that that produced a serious problem in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Ceredigion (Mark Williams) in the case of Cefn Croes. That could have been handled better if the Assembly had had direct powers to deal with it.

Senior police officers in all four police forces in Wales have been saying for some time that the time has come for a move towards the devolution of policing. That feeling has been exacerbated of late by the somewhat insensitive way in which the Home Secretary is seeking to impose an all-Wales force in place of the four that we have at present.<a name = "60123-35_para5"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Llwyd"--><a name="stpa_218"></a>We are proud of our police forces in Wales, and all four are in the upper quartile of each league table in which they appear. They were also recently given an excellent clean bill of health by Her MajestySSSQQQs inspectorate of constabulary and therefore have every reason to say that they are happy with their lot, and with the status quo. They believe that the only way of maintaining that is to devolve policing to the National Assembly, with which would come the probation service and the Prison Service. Both the National Association of Probation Officers in Wales and the Prison Service have expressed warm views about the path towards further devolution, and the way in which they see their future. We believe that they should be taken together as a package, as it were. That impetus has been given extra power by the fact that the National Offender Management Service is now being considered by the Government. This would effectively bring privatisation into the probation service and the Prison Service.<a name="st_485"></a>

We have been promised legislation, and legislation has been introduced and then withdrawn. We are still waiting for that legislation. Rumour has it that no NOMS legislation will now come forward, and that instead a small part of a mixed Home Office Bill will be allocated to the proposals.

Anyone who knows anything about those services knows that they are like chalk and cheese; they are incompatible. Even though they are both part of a wider service, they are not compatible with each other. One is there to befriend and to bring people back out into the wider community; the other is about incarceration, which involves elements of retribution as well as of education. These issues worry the people who work in those services in Wales and if NAPO and the Prison Service were to conduct an opinion poll or take a vote on the matter, people would say overwhelmingly that their future would lie better in Cardiff than with the Home Office.<a name = "60123-35_para6"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Llwyd"--><a name="stpa_219"></a>I am grateful for this opportunity to make those points, and I hope that the Minister will give a reasoned response to the amendments.<a name="st_487"></a>

The two amendments would broaden devolution into areas such as energy, police and the probation and Prison Service, with which the Assembly does not currently have the Executive functions to deal. That goes against the basic premise for the way in which we have established the fields in schedule 5. Those fields, as they are set out, are exclusively those areas in which the Assembly currently has Executive functions. The proposals for which hon.

If at some point in future the Welsh Assembly Government assume Executive functions in a new field, it will be possible for schedule 5 to be amended to add that. The Bill is not intended to alter the boundaries of the current devolution settlement. It changes the structures and mechanisms, but the appropriate means of transferring new responsibilities in new fields from UK Ministers to the Welsh Assembly Government is either an Act of Parliament or an Order in Council. Under clause 58, that could include a transfer of functions order. In those circumstances, schedule 5 could be updated to enable legislative competence in respect of that field to be conferred on the Assembly. However, it should be for Parliament to agree at the time whether those responsibilities are such that it would be appropriate to enable the Assembly to acquire legislative competence in that field, too.<a name="st_493"></a>

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1261"--><a name="60123-37_spnew1"></a><b> Mrs. Cheryl Gillan:</b><!--Mrs. Cheryl Gillan--> These amendments are really probing amendments in respect of amendment of schedule 5, scrutiny of which has just been completed. In truth, I have tabled them to explore the extent of the legislative competency envisaged for the Assembly Measures and to invite the Minister fully to explain the scope for extending the AssemblySSSQQQs powers, using the fields outlined in schedule 5.<a name = "60123-37_para0"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mrs. Gillan"--><a name="stpa_228"></a>As I understand it, the legislative competence orders as described by the Minister in his explanatory letter of 17 January would add a matter to schedule 5. However, the schedule, which contains 20 fields, is an imprecise document. The Government chose to go into detail in field 13, on the National Assembly for Wales. For example, it contains matter 13.1, on the creation and conferral of functions, matter 13.2, which deals with similar provisions, and matters 13.3 to 13.6. However, the other fields have been left completely blank, as the Minister knows. That is tantalising, is it not? The moment one leaves such fields blank, the curiosity of the average politician is understandably aroused.<a name = "60123-37_para1"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mrs. Gillan"--><a name="stpa_229"></a>The examples that the Minister so obligingly sent us, to show how this provision would function, included that of the public services ombudsman and one relating to transport. He said that the Assembly would not have been able to pass measures relating to such matters before enactment of this legislation. That sets aside the fact that we already have primary legislation on these two examples, but that should not cloud the issue. I believe that the Minister chose them—I hope that he can confirm this—because they happened to be before the House. So in a sense this is a red herring—these are simply the examples that he has used. He did say that they are based on cases where the Assembly could not have legislated within its existing powers.<a name = "60123-37_para2"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mrs. Gillan"--><a name="stpa_230"></a>It would appear that there will be no check or balance if the Bill goes through. Field 10, for example, covers all highways and transport matters, and field 14 is headed "public administration", and those would, presumably, cover the other field for the example that the Minister gave. Those two fields would be prayed in aid for the two measures.<a name = "60123-37_para3"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mrs. Gillan"--><a name="stpa_231"></a>I gather from the Library that the addition of those two areas over and above the devolved subjects in schedule 2 to the Government of Wales Act 1998 and the subsequent amendments made by S.I. 1999/672, S.I 2000/253, S.I. 2000/1289, S.I. 2000/1830, S.I. 2001/3679 and S.I. 2004/3004 enhances the competencies of the Assembly above what was previous envisaged. Some of that is laid out in devolution guidance note 11, but I think I am correct in saying that that has not been fully updated.<a name = "60123-37_para4"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mrs. Gillan"--><a name="stpa_232"></a>Some obvious changes derive from some of those statutory instruments. We have mentioned fire and rescue services, and there is the addition of rural development. Other areas are transport—field 10—public administration, and field 15, which is on social welfare. That, I think, is supposed to be equivalent to what used to be called social services. "Social welfare" draws the category much wider. I would be grateful if the Minister gave us the history of the variations and outlined the reasons for the extensions and variations to the powers of the Assembly. I appreciate that some will be introduced functions.<br><br><a name="column_1262"></a><br><br><a name="st_506"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1262"--><a name="60123-37_spnew2"></a><b> Mr. Philip Hollobone</b><!--Mr. Philip Hollobone-->: I should like to underline the point that my hon. Friend is making. Is there not a worrying inconsistency in part 1 of schedule 5, where there is one line of text for most services, but some 40 lines for the Assembly powers? Does not that give the Executive of the Westminster Parliament huge flexibility, and therefore inordinate power, to determine at a later date, beyond the scrutiny of this Parliament, what powers are given to the Assembly?<a name="st_507"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1262"--><a name="60123-37_spnew3"></a><b> Mrs. Cheryl Gillan:</b><!--Mrs. Cheryl Gillan--> My hon. Friend makes his point in his own way, and I shall make it in my way a bit later on. It is arguable that the way in which the Bill has been drawn is so wide that it could be wider than schedule 7, which limits and provides the exceptions. It is an extremely valid point.<a name = "60123-37_para5"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mrs. Gillan"--><a name="stpa_233"></a>Transfers of functions orders have already been brought in in respect of various matters, such as court cases involving subordinate legislation, local land charges, inheritance tax and a right to be party to proceedings on compatibility with the Human Rights Act 1988. Will the Minister outline under which fields those matters, for example, could be covered? That is extremely important. I need to feel that the Minister has fully explained to the House how widely the fields are drawn. Let me give an example. Under "economic development", it could be argued that it might be possible for the Assembly to promote the development of nuclear power in Wales, and thus support a new nuclear power station at Wylfa B. As we heard as we debated the last set of amendments, there is great concern about that in Wales. Perhaps there is a way to claim field 4 as the encompassing field for discussing, promoting or moving those matters forward. It would be of interest to know whether that could or could not be.<a name = "60123-37_para6"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mrs. Gillan"--><a name="stpa_234"></a>Under "social welfare", could the Assembly add the provision of social security benefits or employment programmes aimed at all unemployed people? Could it add child support or pension regulation, all of which currently remain wholly the responsibility of the UK Government? Are the headings a pointer to the direction that the Government wish to take, in which case could the Minister enlighten us further? Or do the Government seek to maintain the status quo in these fields, in which case, could they be filled in? If they are not filled in—as schedule 7 has been completed in detail to cover the situation in which full legislative powers are devolved—it could be argued that schedule 5 could be interpreted to cover a wider remit than schedule 7. The Minister should clarify that very generally drawn schedule, because otherwise it might not find favour in this Committee or in the other place.<a name="time_21"></a><a name = "60123-37_time0"></a>XZXZomit desc="time"YWYW9.15 pmXZXZ/omitYWYW<a name="st_508"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1262"--><a name="60123-37_spnew4"></a><b> Mr. David Jones:</b><!--Mr. David Jones--> Does my hon. Friend share my puzzlement that the Minister has repeatedly said this evening that it is the GovernmentSSSQQQs intention not to broaden but to deepen the devolution settlement, but it would be possible for the Government to add any number of fields to those already contained in schedule 5, subject of course to the limitations in schedule 7? My concern is that it may be possible at some later stage for a large number of additional fields that are not currently the subject of the devolution settlement to be added.<br><br><a name="column_1263"></a><br><br><a name="st_509"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1263"--><a name="60123-37_spnew5"></a><b> Mrs. Cheryl Gillan:</b><!--Mrs. Cheryl Gillan--> It is for the Minister to answer that point and set our minds at rest, or to come clean about the GovernmentSSSQQQs intentions. When we see a provision drawn so widely, it sets the alarm bells ringing on what the Father of the House called creeping devolution. It could become a reality.<a name = "60123-37_para7"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mrs. Gillan"--><a name="stpa_235"></a>This is a difficult area, but as I understand it the devolved subjects that were listed in schedule 2 to the Government of Wales Act 1998 are not repeated exactly in this Bill. They have been supplemented and slightly changed. I would like to hear from the Minister his views on the breadth of those fields. If he is intent on deepening rather than widening, perhaps he will allay our fears that the Bill will widen the devolution settlement by including headings as broad as "social welfare".<a name="st_510"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1263"--><a name="60123-37_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Commissioner of Her MajestySSSQQQs Treasury Mr.   Nick Ainger:</b><!--Lord Commissioner of Her MajestySSSQQQs Treasury Mr.   Nick Ainger--> If I begin by explaining how schedule 5 is set out, it may assist the hon. Lady to understand how the process works. The fields that are set out are those areas in which Executive functions have been given to the Assembly and, following the split that will be introduced by the enactment of this Bill, to Assembly Ministers. They are the fields of Executive competence.<a name = "60123-37_para8"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Nick Ainger"--><a name="stpa_236"></a>The hon. Lady mentions field 13, which is purely about the National Assembly for Wales. In order for the Assembly to be able to carry out its functions, pay its staff and so on, we had to set out in the Bill the matters on which it may legislate if required at as early an opportunity as possible. For all the other fields listed with nothing underneath them, it will be for the process of Orders in Council to determine.<a name = "60123-37_para9"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Nick Ainger"--><a name="stpa_237"></a>The hon. Lady mentioned the two examples that I placed in the Library—legislation on the public administration ombudsman and transport in Wales. If we had not gone for the primary route, that is how an Order in Council would have looked. The transport legislation would have fitted under the field. I do not know which one it is—<a name="st_511"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1263"--><a name="60123-37_spnew7"></a><b> Mrs. Cheryl Gillan:</b><!--Mrs. Cheryl Gillan--> Field 10.<a name="st_512"></a>

The matter would come under field 10 and still have the heading "highways and transport". The matter, as defined in the Order in Council, would sit underneath that heading.<a name = "60123-38_para0"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Nick Ainger"--><a name="stpa_238"></a>Some of the confusion may arise from the way in which the Bill is set out. There is a series of headings: "Schedule 5", "Assembly Measures", "Part 1" and "Matters", but that is then followed by the list of fields. That may have caused a little confusion. I hope the hon. Lady now understands the process.<a name = "60123-38_para1"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Nick Ainger"--><a name="stpa_239"></a>I now come to the question of how more fields can be added. The hon. Lady is right to suggest that additional fields of Executive functions have been added since the 1998 Act. That has been done by a combination of primary legislation—for example, the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 transferred the Executive functions for the fire brigades in Wales to the Assembly—and the transfer of functions orders, the most obvious example being that for animal health. We envisage that those processes will continue. If agreement was reached between the Government and the Welsh Assembly<br><br><a name="column_1264"></a><br><br>Government that additional competence should be given to the Assembly, those are the procedures that would be used.<a name="st_513"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1264"--><a name="60123-38_spnew1"></a><b> Mrs. Cheryl Gillan:</b><!--Mrs. Cheryl Gillan--> Can the Minister tell me where the provision for rural development came from in field 1? I gather that the old grouping was agriculture, forestry, fisheries and foods.<a name="st_514"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1264"--><a name="60123-38_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Commissioner of Her MajestySSSQQQs Treasury Mr.   Nick Ainger:</b><!--Lord Commissioner of Her MajestySSSQQQs Treasury Mr.   Nick Ainger--> That is a good question. I cannot give an answer off the top of my head, but I lived next door to the Assembly Minister responsible for these matters for the first two or three years. I assure the hon. Lady that, from the word go, Christine Gwyther was actively involved in rural development. I am certain that she was acting quite properly in dealing with these matters. However, I will get a detailed response of how that issue has now become an Executive function.<a name="st_515"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1264"--><a name="60123-38_spnew3"></a><b> Mr. Elfyn Llwyd:</b><!--Mr. Elfyn Llwyd--> Bearing in mind that the Minister lived next door to the other Minister, may I take it that that was joined-up government?<a name="st_516"></a>

The hon. Gentleman is quite right.<a name = "60123-38_para2"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Nick Ainger"--><a name="stpa_240"></a>I now wish to explain how the Orders in Council would be used to amend schedule 5. If a transfer of functions order transfers Executive power from a UK Minister to a Welsh Assembly Minister, hon. Members may ask why there should not be a requirement to add that field to schedule 5. I do not propose this, but let us bear in mind the earlier debate about energy. If Executive functions were to be transferred from the Department of Trade and Industry to the Assembly Minister responsible for that issue—I imagine that it would be Andrew Davies—the transfer of functions order would clearly set out what was being transferred to the Assembly.<a name = "60123-38_para3"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Nick Ainger"--><a name="stpa_241"></a>One might argue that the logic is that the transfer of functions order should also include the order that would also give the power to legislate. However, the Orders in Council give the powers to the Assembly to legislate whereas the transfer of function order is from Minister to Minister. That is why we would still have to have a separate Order in Council giving the Assembly the responsibility to legislate. The Executive function must be transferred—that is the first thing that must happen. That would trigger the field being added and then, in the fullness of time, an Order in Council would set out the legislative transfer.<a name="st_517"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1264"--><a name="60123-38_spnew5"></a><b> Mrs. Cheryl Gillan:</b><!--Mrs. Cheryl Gillan--> Perhaps I am being stupid on this. Is the Minister telling me that a transfer of functions order relating to the details of each field will be passed following the enactment of the Bill, or will that happen only for subsequent matters? The matters have been widened from those in schedule 2 to the 1998 Act, so I need to know how that widening has happened. If it has happened due to all the statutory instruments that I cited, that is well and good, but that does not appear to be the case. Have amendments been made to broaden the matters and give the fields broader headings? For example, the field of "social welfare" has been changed from social services.<a name="st_518"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1264"--><a name="60123-38_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Commissioner of Her MajestySSSQQQs Treasury Mr.   Nick Ainger:</b><!--Lord Commissioner of Her MajestySSSQQQs Treasury Mr.   Nick Ainger--> I thought that I had explained the situation earlier, but I shall try to do so again. The bulk<br><br><a name="column_1265"></a><br><br>of the fields set out in the schedule arose due to the transfer of Executive powers that followed the enactment of the Government of Wales Act 1998. The fields that the hon. Lady cannot find in schedule 2 to the 1998 Act are those that have been transferred since then either by primary legislation—I cited the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 earlier, which transferred executive responsibility for the fire brigade to the Assembly—or by transfer of functions orders, such as that on animal welfare. There might well be a question about the wording or descriptions used in the Bill, but Executive functions must have come from the 1998 Act, other primary legislation or a transfer of functions order. They could not have come from anywhere else. The Assembly could not have given itself Executive powers without the approval of Parliament in some form.<a name="st_519"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1265"--><a name="60123-38_spnew7"></a><b> Mrs. Cheryl Gillan:</b><!--Mrs. Cheryl Gillan--> The Minister is going some way towards explaining the situation.

The hon. Lady indicated that amendments Nos. 166 and 167 were probing amendments. I hope that she is happy with, and reassured by, my explanation of how the process will work and new fields will be added, and that she will thus withdraw the amendment.<a name="st_521"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1265"--><a name="60123-38_spnew9"></a><b> Mrs. Cheryl Gillan:</b><!--Mrs. Cheryl Gillan--> The Minister has struggled hard with what is obviously a complicated aspect of the Bill. I shall withdraw the amendment, but I remain confused about how and why several fields have changed. I understand the straightforward result of the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004, but the inclusion of the category of transport is a little premature, given that the Transport (Wales) Bill has not completed all its parliamentary stages. It is interesting that a provision can appear in a Bill before the necessary legislation has been passed. I still fail to understand how a transfer of functions order has resulted in the functions on social services being broadened to "social welfare".<a name = "60123-38_para5"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mrs. Gillan"--><a name="stpa_243"></a>As I said, it would be a lot easier if there were the same amount of detail in schedule 5 as in schedule 7. In view of the exceptions and the details laid out in schedule 7, it is arguable that this provision draws the powers much more widely. I hope that the Minister will write to me, because I would like to know under which field the functions in respect of inheritance tax fall, and also those in court cases involving subordinate legislation in devolved fields, and the right to be party to proceedings on compatibility with the Human Rights Act 1998. That would go some way towards explaining a very opaque process, and a very imprecisely drawn part of the Bill.<br><br><a name="column_1266"></a><br><br><a name="time_22"></a><a name = "60123-38_time0"></a>XZXZomit desc="time"YWYW9.30 pmXZXZ/omitYWYW<a name = "60123-38_para6"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mrs. Gillan"--><a name="stpa_244"></a>I am not entirely satisfied.

As I said to the Under-Secretary and the Secretary of State, there are other ways of approaching the problem with a view to improving the manner in which scrutiny is conducted. The amendments in this group are designed to achieve that and to provide an opportunity for the House to consider ways to change the process of scrutiny.<a name = "60123-40_para0"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Grieve"--><a name="stpa_250"></a>I shall deal first with amendments Nos. 180 and 211, which are designed to achieve roughly the same thing via different wording and different places in the text.

I present the amendments as probing amendments.<a name = "60123-40_para1"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Grieve"--><a name="stpa_251"></a>We know that in part 4 the Minister has provided that no initiation of the process of holding a referendum to transfer new legislative power should take place without a two-thirds majority in the Assembly. The Government argue that such a momentous change should occur only if there is a degree of consensus within the Assembly that such a measure should be adopted. However, on several occasions this evening the Minister has said that the difference between that procedure and the procedure set out in part 3 is that in the latter case it is possible to proceed on a case-by-case basis.<a name="time_23"></a><a name = "60123-40_time0"></a>XZXZomit desc="time"YWYW9.45 pmXZXZ/omitYWYW<a name = "60123-40_para2"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Grieve"--><a name="stpa_252"></a>If, for the general principle of a transfer of extra powers, a two thirds majority vote is required of the Assembly, it can certainly be argued that a two thirds majority vote should be required each time the Assembly wishes to proceed on a case by case basis to acquire new powers under the Order-in-Council procedure. Why, in those circumstances, have the Government not considered including such a provision in the Bill? If we want to ensure that the Assembly takes powers only where there is agreement within the Assembly and a consensus in Wales that that should be the case, that would be an adequate safeguard.<a name = "60123-40_para3"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Grieve"--><a name="stpa_253"></a>The principal amendment in this group is amendment No. 187, which sets out a formula for better scrutiny of the legislative process.

Leaving aside for a moment the proposal that I initially made in      amendments Nos. 180 and 211, amendment No. 187 should be seen as standing on its own, although it can be linked to amendment No. 212, which further provides that subsection (5) will not be satisfied unless, before the draft of the statutory instrument containing the Order in Council has been approved by resolution of the House of Commons, the Welsh Grand Committee has debated the draft and the Welsh Affairs Committee has reported that it approves the draft.

We sought to achieve something similar in amendments Nos. 123 and 181, but for reasons that are fairly obvious, I prefer what is attempted in amendment No. 123 to amendment No. 181. Put simply, we find it difficult to understand why the Secretary of State should have the ability to refuse to place a draft before Parliament. Looking at the matter sensibly, one would assume that the Secretary of State holds office because his party has a majority in Parliament.

If there were a constitutional problem relating to it, let him come along and tell us. If we agreed with him, we would doubtless support him. If we disagreed, we could vote on the matter. But to<br><br><a name="column_1272"></a><br><br>provide for a double procedure in which the Secretary of State had a power of veto would appear to introduce the very mischief that I mentioned earlier, namely that this procedure in part 3 gives power to the Executive and removes it from the legislature.

We would seek to ascertain whether, with all the known facts being out in the open, the Minister had acted reasonably in all circumstances, and within his powers. That is all we are asking.

I am not sure whether the Minister will be able to give us a definitive answer to this question today. New clause 4 would strengthen the democratic institution of the Assembly and allow it the same immediate right of referral to the Supreme Court that the Counsel General would have, and that the Attorney-General is given in other parts of the Bill.<a name = "60123-41_para4"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Llwyd"--><a name="stpa_263"></a>Amendment No. 27 states, in effect, that<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_249"></a>"In the event of approval of a draft statutory instrument by the Assembly . . . but there not being within 60 days of that approval, an approval by a resolution of each House of Parliament as specified",</ul><a name = "60123-41_para5"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Llwyd"--><a name="stpa_264"></a>the Assembly could, by a two thirds majority, carry on.

Digital hearing aids, which hitherto had only been available privately at a cost of up to £2,500, were finally to be provided through the NHS,   and substantial investment was to be made available to audiology services to modernise their facilities and service. Since then a great deal has been achieved, and the quality of life of thousands of people, who are now benefiting from a digital aid for the first time, has undergone a dramatic improvement. It is an achievement of which the Government and its partner organisations, such as the Royal National Institute for Deaf People, can be justly proud.<a name = "60123-42_para1"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Howard Stoate"--><a name="stpa_273"></a>While many patients have benefited in the last six years, a significant number of patients who are eligible for a digital aid, but have yet to receive one, are unlikely to have one fitted at any point in the near future.<a name="st_582"></a>

Many parts of the country do not enjoy the service that my hon. Friend has managed to achieve in his area.<a name = "60123-42_para3"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stoate"--><a name="stpa_275"></a>In the last year I have received dozens of letters from patients in Dartford, from people without an existing hearing aid, complaining about the length of the wait for a digital aid. I have also been contacted by a large number of patients with existing analogue aids, to whom the waiting list for a digital aid has been closed until recently. The distress and frustration that that is causing patients and their immediate families is, I need hardly say, considerable. It is particularly acute in the case of patients with existing analogue aids who are struggling to come to terms with the fact that they have no immediate prospect of receiving a digital aid.<br><br><a name="column_1276"></a><br><br><a name = "60123-42_para4"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stoate"--><a name="stpa_276"></a>The digital hearing aid service for residents in the Dartford, Gravesham and Swanley primary care trust area is currently provided by Medway NHS Trust. At present, 244 patients in Dartford and Gravesham are waiting for a "first fit" digital hearing aid. There is currently a 10-month wait, which is considerably longer than the best practice standard in the RNIDSSSQQQs patients guide, "A good audiology service—what you can expect", which was published in 2002. The guide states that waiting times should not exceed the following: from GP referral to first assessment, not more than four weeks; from assessment to first fitting: not more than four weeks; and from first fitting to discharge; not more than eight weeks. Although the level of service is far lower than the best practice standard, it still represents a far better service than that enjoyed by patients who have been waiting to have analogue aids converted to digital aids. Until very recently, patients in that situation had no hope whatever of receiving a digital hearing aid as the waiting list for conversions was closed in order to enable the service to focus its resources on patients waiting for a first digital aid.<a name="st_584"></a>

The staff running the service deserve a lot of credit for that. However, that improvement has been made at the expense of patients with existing analogue aids, regardless of their clinical need, which concerns me.<a name = "60123-42_para7"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stoate"--><a name="stpa_279"></a>Medway NHS Trust claims that its hand has been forced to a large extent by the introduction of a new waiting time target for NHS and diagnostic services, which states that, by 2008, no patient will have to wait longer than 18 weeks from referral to hospital treatment. The trust has interpreted that target as meaning that "new patients", that is,<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_250"></a>"those patients with no amplification whatsoever"</ul><a name = "60123-42_para8"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stoate"--><a name="stpa_280"></a>should be prioritised. That is stated in a letter from the Medway NHS Trust chief executiveSSSQQQs office dated 25 August 2005. However, I would welcome clarification from the Minister on that point. In my opinion the waiting list target should apply to people with existing aids who have experienced further hearing loss as well as to people who have no amplification.<br><br><a name="column_1277"></a><br><br><a name = "60123-42_para9"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stoate"--><a name="stpa_281"></a>Although the waiting list is now open again to patients with existing aids, patients are still facing an extremely long wait and I feel that a fresh approach, which is based purely on clinical need and is free from such arbitrary distinctions between patients, is necessary. When the modernising hearing aid services project was launched, the RNID recommended that patients with analogue aids awaiting conversion to a digital aid should undergo a clinical assessment, so that the most vulnerable and needy patients could be given priority. It is extremely disappointing, therefore, that that is not happening.<a name = "60123-42_para10"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stoate"--><a name="stpa_282"></a>The national framework contract public-private partnership with David Ormerod Hearing Centres and Ultravox, which was introduced in 2003, also makes a distinction between new patients without a hearing aid and existing patients with analogue aids. The PPP programme has made a significant difference to the lives of many new patients since its introduction and has been an undoubted success in many ways. It has enabled thousands of patients, who otherwise would still be waiting, to receive their first hearing aid. That comes as little consolation to existing patients in Dartford, however, who are not eligible for the scheme and still face a prolonged wait for a new digital aid.<a name="st_586"></a>

Gentleman on securing the debate and on raising this important issue. Are not digital hearing aids a perfect example of the NHS finding it difficult to deliver medical improvements in technology, despite the best efforts of all its staff, the Government and Ministers? Is not that an example of the NHS finding it difficult to deliver the services that people want?<a name="st_587"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1277"--><a name="60123-42_spnew6"></a><b> Dr. Howard Stoate:</b><!--Dr. Howard Stoate--> The hon. Gentleman is right, but I shall explain some of the reasons for that. The fault is not the GovernmentSSSQQQs alone, and the system has worked well in some areas, but the service is patchy and we must try to bring all areas up to the best level. It is not true that the NHS is unable to fulfil contracts and deliver a good service, as it is clear that it has managed to do so in many parts of the country.<a name = "60123-42_para11"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stoate"--><a name="stpa_283"></a>It is apparent, however, that a lack of resources—that is, facilities, staff and finance—still hinders the NHSSSSQQQ ability to deliver the level of service that patients have a right to expect. The Department of Health announced in January 2000 that £94 million was to be made available to modernise hearing aid services in England and said that, by April 2005, the latest digital hearing aids would be available for those people across the country who could benefit from them. Although digital aids are available in north-west Kent, we are still a long way from achieving the unfettered access envisaged in 2000.<a name = "60123-42_para12"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stoate"--><a name="stpa_284"></a>The Darent Valley hospital patient and public involvement forum has campaigned tirelessly on this matter, and has suggested that many of the present problems result from a shortfall in funding from the Department of Health. It asserts that Government funding has covered only the cost of the hearing aids themselves and the associated computer equipment. The funding also helped to meet some, but by no means all,<br><br><a name="column_1278"></a><br><br>of the extra staffing costs associated with the increased work load, and that has obliged local PCTs to make up the difference from existing funds—something that they struggle to do. One member of the PPI forum, John Beadle, has said that<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_251"></a>"although funds have been allocated"</ul><a name = "60123-42_para13"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stoate"--><a name="stpa_285"></a>to trusts,<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_252"></a>"they were insufficient to meet all the requirements of audiology departments to fully support the SSSQQQModernising Hearing Aids ServiceSSSQQQ programme."</ul><a name = "60123-42_para14"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stoate"--><a name="stpa_286"></a>Another major problem impeding the Dartford PCTSSSQQQs efforts to improve services is the shortage of suitable facilities. An outreach centre operated by staff from Medway, and using equipment from that trust, is available at Darent Valley hospital, but it consists of only one room. That is absurdly inadequate for an area with a population of almost 200,000.<a name = "60123-42_para15"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stoate"--><a name="stpa_287"></a>Medway NHS trust has put together a business plan for the development of audiology services, and it seems likely that some of the capital will be used to fund the creation of an additional audiology room. Even with that extra room, however, the trust will still not have the level of facilities that it needs to deliver an effective service. It will still be far below the recommended level of provision set out in the best practice standards for adult audiology published in 2002 by the Department of Health and the RNID. In addition, even if the service is able to recruit and retain a full team of staff, and to ensure that a full range of equipment is made available, it still will not have the necessary facilities to house them.<a name = "60123-42_para16"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stoate"--><a name="stpa_288"></a>Like all areas of the country, the service in Dartford is also affected by a shortage of audiologists. An audiology degree course has now been introduced and more qualified audiologists are now entering the profession but, with the demand for digital hearing aids continuing to increase, the service is struggling to keep up.<a name = "60123-42_para17"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stoate"--><a name="stpa_289"></a>More and more people are seeking help with their hearing problems and that is, of course, to be encouraged. We have known for a long time that there is an enormous amount of unmet need around the country, and it is good that people are coming forward for help, encouraged perhaps by some of the recent announcements that have been made by the Department of Health. I am worried, however, that those people—some of whom might also have been encouraged to seek help by their friends and families—may quickly lose heart and give up when confronted by a lengthy wait for a fitting.<a name = "60123-42_para18"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stoate"--><a name="stpa_290"></a>It is apparent that the lengthy waits experienced by patients in Dartford are common in many parts of the country. A recent survey carried out for the British Society of Hearing Aid Audiologists found that 41 per cent. of hospitals reported that queues of patients needing a hearing aid are longer now than in 2004. According to the society, it now takes seven weeks longer than it did in 2004 to see a specialist, have a hearing test and eventually get a hearing aid fitted.<a name = "60123-42_para19"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stoate"--><a name="stpa_291"></a>The worst affected region is the south-east. By autumn 2005, the average wait there rose from 58 weeks in 2004 to 81 weeks, according to the BSHAA. In the north-east, the average wait went up from 18 weeks to 48 weeks, and the average wait in the west midlands is now 65 weeks.<br><br><a name="column_1279"></a><br><br><a name = "60123-42_para20"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stoate"--><a name="stpa_292"></a>In some trust areas, the average wait is considerably longer still: the BSHAA reported total waiting times in 2005 of 130 weeks at the Royal Sussex County hospital in Brighton, of 156 weeks at BirminghamSSSQQQs City hospital, and of 106 weeks at the Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother hospital in Margate. In contrast, the average total wait from referral to fitting is around 31 weeks in the east midlands region, and 35 weeks in the northern region.Again, that shows the existing disparity across the country. The speed of service that a patient can expect therefore varies widely from place to place, and that is clearly unacceptable.<a name = "60123-42_para21"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stoate"--><a name="stpa_293"></a>Waiting times are by no means the only issue that patients are concerned about. For example, a number of people have also approached me with concerns about the level of choice that exists in terms of the types of digital aid available to eligible patients. Although in-the-ear aids are available to private patients, NHS patients have access only to behind-the-ear aids, which   many people find cosmetically unacceptable. Unfortunately, most NHS patients are unaware of this until they come to have a digital aid fitted. Not unnaturally, they are often very disappointed. This is particularly true of patients who receive their aid through companies involved in the public-private partnership scheme, which have of course spent considerable sums advertising availability of in-the-ear aids.<a name = "60123-42_para22"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stoate"--><a name="stpa_294"></a>I am also concerned that, because of the pressure on local audiology services, patients who have been fitted with a digital aid may not be getting the rehabilitation and aftercare that they need to ensure that they make full use of the aid. The aftercare burden faced by audiology services has become even heavier since the introduction of the PPP scheme, as the companies taking part in it are not involved in the aftercare of NHS patients whose digital aids they fit. A telephone follow-up service has been introduced by the NHS, and it is clear that it is working in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor), but it is not ideal and no substitute for ongoing, personal, face-to-face consultations.<a name = "60123-42_para23"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stoate"--><a name="stpa_295"></a>It is clear that lack of effective service monitoring and audit arrangements at local level have contributed to the parlous situation in which many audiology services now find themselves. The Department of Health, the Royal National Institute for Deaf People and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence have all published guidance on how local services should run. For example, NICE issued guidance on hearing aid technology as long ago as July 2000. It recommended that audits be performed to assess the performance of audiology departments. Two years later, the Department of Health and the RNID published their "Best Practice Standards for Adult Audiology", which set out the standards that<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_253"></a>"all audiology departments will want to work towards".</ul><a name = "60123-42_para24"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stoate"--><a name="stpa_296"></a>It concludes by saying that<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_254"></a>"a scheme should be put in place for monitoring and audit on a regular basis."</ul><a name = "60123-42_para25"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stoate"--><a name="stpa_297"></a>It seems, however, that few trusts have been able to implement either the best practice standards or the NICE guidelines fully. In many places, no attempt whatsoever has been made to implement them. Moreover, since those guidelines were published, little<br><br><a name="column_1280"></a><br><br>or no attempt has been made at national level to assess the quality of service being delivered in terms of waiting times, or to see whether the guidelines are being adhered to.<a name = "60123-42_para26"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stoate"--><a name="stpa_298"></a>Part of the problem up to now is that unlike accident and emergency or cancer waiting times, the Healthcare Commission does not take into consideration audiology waiting times in setting each trustSSSQQQs annual performance rating. This problem is compounded by the fact that the Department of Health does not collect records of waiting times in each trust on the fitting of hearing aids. Both those oversights need to be addressed if we are to have a more accurate understanding of the situation on the ground in each area.<a name = "60123-42_para27"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stoate"--><a name="stpa_299"></a>The new Department of Health 18-week treatment target for audiology patients by 2008 is a welcome step forward, but as I have already alluded to, to whom this waiting list target actually applies needs to be clarified. Does it apply to all patients, or just to those without any amplification? I should also be grateful for clarification of the level of treatment that the target refers to. Does it apply simply to the waiting time from general practitioner referral to an appointment with an ear, nose and throat consultant, or to the waiting time from GP referral to final fitting? It needs to refer to the latter if it is to have any credibility. A more robust and transparent system of targets, assessment and audit is absolutely essential if the service is to improve across the country.<a name = "60123-42_para28"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stoate"--><a name="stpa_300"></a>Resources remain the ultimate obstacle, however, to service improvement. I have already referred to the   straitened circumstances in which the audiology service in Dartford is operating. I hope that the accommodation problems that Dartford is experiencing are not the norm across the country. An assessment of the appropriateness of the accommodation in which each service is functioning needs to be carried out, and I ask the Minister to ensure that it is.<a name = "60123-42_para29"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stoate"--><a name="stpa_301"></a>An assessment of the financial capacity of each service to deliver its basic commitments also needs to be carried out. The RNID document "Sustaining your modernised audiology service" maintains that adult services in England<ul><p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_255"></a>"have been fully funded to fit digital aids, and an increase to reflect ongoing commitments has now become part of the baseline allocation to trusts."</ul><a name = "60123-42_para30"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stoate"--><a name="stpa_302"></a>The evidence from Dartford and from the BSHAA, however, suggests that trusts are finding it difficult to meet their obligations to patients, and that the funding provided is nowhere near sufficient to meet demand. Funding for audiology services ceased to be ring-fenced in April 2005 and audiology services now have to compete for funding with other health care departments. So it is unlikely that the funding situation will improve in the immediate future, given the state of most trustsSSSQQQ funding. Until requisite funding is made available that is based on an accurate assessment of the level of need in each community, audiology services will undoubtedly struggle to cater for existing demand.<a name = "60123-42_para31"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Stoate"--><a name="stpa_303"></a>In some ways, the Department of Health has become a victim of its own success in marketing digital hearing aids. In the past five years, thousands of patients have been persuaded, thanks to the efforts the Department of Health and the RNID, of the advantages that a digital aid can offer, and they have become aware of their availability on the NHS. Demand has therefore risen<br><br><a name="column_1281"></a><br><br>dramatically across the country, in most cases well beyond the capacity of the local audiology service. We cannot afford for the progress made in the past few years to be wasted. A thorough review of the way in which audiology is funded, delivered and monitored is therefore essential. I urge the Minister to make it a priority.<a name="time_25"></a><a name = "60123-42_time1"></a>XZXZomit desc="time"YWYW10.20 pmXZXZ/omitYWYW<a name="st_588"></a>

Like him, I believe that people who need hearing aids should have access not only to the latest technology, but to a high quality service. I thank him for his recognition of the dramatic national progress of the past five years in audiology, particularly the move from the old-fashioned analogue aids towards offering modern digital hearing aids.<a name = "60123-43_para0"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Ms Rosie Winterton"--><a name="stpa_304"></a>My hon. Friend referred to the situation in his area. I pay tribute to the national health service staff in his constituency who have worked hard locally and done much to bring down waiting lists. I shall come to some of the problems that he has outlined and set out some of the ways in which we are addressing them. I should, however, put it on the record that the average waiting time for first fitting of digital hearing aids in all areas served by Medway Maritime Hospital Trust is 40 weeks. That sounds a long time, but it has come down from approximately 100 weeks—nearly two years—in early 2005. The trust plans to bring that below 10 weeks. The trust also plans to see 70 patients per month who are waiting for conversion from analogue to digital hearing aids. As part of that, there have been a number of local initiatives. One in Dartford, involving Gravesham primary care trust, is providing services to something like 600 extra patients, some of whom require analogue to digital conversions, by using private sector providers.<a name = "60123-43_para1"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Ms Rosie Winterton"--><a name="stpa_305"></a>The team at the Medway trust is also carrying out group-fit sessions that enable more patients to be seen, and that is giving valuable peer support. Audiology facilities at Darent Valley hospital are to be extended, and recruitment of additional staff is under way. Audiology services at Gravesend hospital is to be moved to the new Gravesend community hospital later this year, and service links at the new facility will enable more sessions to be carried out at Gravesend to complement the sessions at Darent Valley hospital. In addition, £606,000 from the modernising hearing aid services initiative is being used this financial year across Kent to bring down waiting times. Finally, Kent and Medway strategic health authority is establishing an audiology group to look with PCTs and trusts at the impact of some of those current initiatives and to set further targets and trajectories for waiting lists in 2006.<a name = "60123-43_para2"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Ms Rosie Winterton"--><a name="stpa_306"></a>My hon. Friend mentioned the initial £125 million investment in modernising NHS audiology services. He asked what that covered, and I can confirm that it covered staffing and training in the new modernising hearing aids services procedures as well as equipment and information systems.<br><br><a name="column_1282"></a><br><br><a name = "60123-43_para3"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Ms Rosie Winterton"--><a name="stpa_307"></a>All NHS audiology services are now able to fit digital hearing aids routinely and I reassure my hon. Friend that the Department would neither advocate nor promote treating only those without analogue aids. I am pleased to see that my hon. FriendSSSQQQs trust is now working to fit analogue aid wearers with digital hearing aids. However, I agree that we still have a long way to go. As my hon. Friend said, demand has grown enormously, and that has led to long waits in some areas.<a name="st_589"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1282"--><a name="60123-43_spnew0"></a><b> Mr. Brooks Newmark  (Braintree) (Con):</b><!--Mr. Brooks Newmark--> I, too, wish to congratulate the hon. Member for Dartford (Dr.   Stoate) on raising this important issue. I also congratulate the Minister on her willingness to try to achieve the goals that the hon. Gentleman seeks. The challenge, however, arises from the funding crisis that many PCTs are suffering. How does the Minister intend to bridge the gap between the important objectives that she seeks to achieve and the funding crisis?<a name="st_590"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1282"--><a name="60123-43_spnew1"></a><b> Ann Winterton:</b><!--Ann Winterton--> It is important to be clear that the NHS has received enormous investment, and all PCTs have benefited from that. We need to ensure that PCTs manage their finances properly, and if that is not sorted out the finances will not be on the even keel necessary to fund some of the new services that are coming on line. Financial management is vital to enable some of the PCTs that have difficulties to get on an even keel so that those services are provided by all PCTs.<a name = "60123-43_para4"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Ms Winterton"--><a name="stpa_308"></a>We are taking several measures to tackle the problems, including 350 additional audiology posts and a new four-year BSc degree in audiology with a total of 348 students in training. The national framework contract public-private partnership will allow NHS trusts to use private hearing aid dispensers, which is just the sort of initiative that is being used in my hon.   FriendSSSQQQs constituency. As my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) mentioned, we are also introducing Hearing Direct, an optional telephone-based service that offers follow-up care and advice for selected hearing aid users. It will not suit everybody, and I wish to emphasise that if face-to-face contact is still necessary after the telephone contact, it will still be on offer. However, Hearing Direct is an exciting initiative that has achieved a high degree of satisfaction among users, not least because it can reduce the time that they spend travelling to out-patient appointments.<a name = "60123-43_para5"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Ms Winterton"--><a name="stpa_309"></a>In the time remaining, I wish to address a few more of the points that my hon. Friend mentioned, such as the availability of in-the-ear aids compared with behind-the-ear aids. The MHAS procurement group, chaired by the RNID, agreed that the default position would be the provision of a range of behind-the-ear devices. However, if a specific clinical need for an in-the-ear device was indicated, one would be provided.<a name = "60123-43_para6"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Ms Winterton"--><a name="stpa_310"></a>My hon. Friend also mentioned accommodation provision, which should be part of local service planning arrangements. The Medway NHS trust is considering using some of its capital to fund the creation of an additional audiology room. Even one room can cost something like £100,000, but I must emphasise that it is a matter for local PCTs to decide how they wish to address some of the accommodation issues.<a name = "60123-43_para7"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Ms Winterton"--><a name="stpa_311"></a>We are also looking at further action on waiting times through the national physiological measurement programme. One of the development sites for this work<br><br><a name="column_1283"></a><br><br>is at the East Kent Hospitals NHS Trust and the outcome of that will be shared across the strategic health authority.<a name = "60123-43_para8"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Ms Winterton"--><a name="stpa_312"></a>My hon. Friend asked particularly about the 18-week target, and we are looking at the principles and definitions for that target. We started consultation that closed on 8 December. Audiology, as a whole, is one of the disciplines that we are considering at the moment and, following ministerial approval to the final principles and definitions, we will be publishing guidance within the next two months.<br><br><a name="column_1284"></a><br><br><a name = "60123-43_para9"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Ms Winterton"--><a name="stpa_313"></a>My hon.

There is no central audit of practice by the Department—<a name = "60123-43_para10"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Ms Winterton"--><a name="stpa_314"></a><i>The motion being made after Ten oSSSQQQclock, and the debate having continued for half an hour,</i> Mr. Deputy Speaker<i>adjourned the House without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.</i><br><ul><ul><ul><a name="adj_0"></a>Adjourned at twenty-nine minutes to Eleven oSSSQQQclock.</ul></ul></ul></html>
