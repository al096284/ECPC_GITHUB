We can see that in higher education. International education is now worth £12.5 billion to this economy and international students bring in £8.5 billion to our colleges. I agree with the right hon. Gentleman that there is a need for tougher controls on students and every other foreign national. That is why we no longer issue visas without checking people's fingerprints and why we will introduce identity cards on a compulsory basis, for those, including students, who want to stay in the country for longer than six months.

The number of student visas issued annually is significantly more than double the number of work permits issued to foreign nationals. What contact has the Minister had with the representative bodies for the institutions at which the students are registered? Surely they must have a part to play in all this, whether they are at the top end of the spectrum, such as the London School of Economics, or at the bottom end, with some fairly dodgy, hole-in-the-corner colleges with bogus courses that are just there as a means of access to the UK.<a name="st_o8"></a><a name="0801142000034"></a>

That is why, when the points-based system is introduced, we will introduce much tighter sponsorship arrangements for colleges. In order for colleges to be able to understand whether the student appearing in the classroom is indeed the student whom they sponsored to get a student visa, they must of course be clear about their identity. That is why fingerprint visas are so important, and why compulsory ID cards for foreign nationals are so important too.

The system works effectively, but it has to dovetail with the general tightening of border protection that we propose over the next year or two.

Under the points system, the system will get tighter still, and colleges will be required to disclose proactively all cases of non-attendance to us. If we are talking about systems that will have some kind of purchase on foreign students, the hon.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="657"-->The Education and Skills Bill is a landmark piece of legislation—the biggest reform in educational participation for more than 50 years. Its provisions to raise the education-leaving age from 16 to 17 by 2013 and to 18 by 2015 will fulfil a century-long ambition of this House to deliver educational opportunity for all young people.<a name="stpa_o19"></a><a name="80114-0004.htm_para3"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Ed Balls"--><a name="0801142000165"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="657"-->For nearly 100 years, Parliament has expressed its belief that all young people should be in education or training until the age of 18. The Fisher Act of 1918 raised the school-leaving age from 12 to 14, but it also included a provision stating that all young people should participate in at least part-time study until the age of 18. We all know that that bold commitment was reneged on during the early years after the first world war, but in 1944 the Butler Act raised the leaving age to 15 and made provision for a rise to 16 as soon as possible, as well as for compulsory participation until 18. Although the school-leaving age eventually rose to 16 in 1972, it has remained unchanged since—once again, the provision to raise the education participation age to 18 was not enacted.<a name="stpa_o20"></a><a name="80114-0004.htm_para4"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Ed Balls"--><a name="0801142000166"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="657"-->But our society and economy have changed dramatically since the early 1970s. What was visionary 90 years ago is essential today, both economically and for reasons of social justice. Lord Leitch's projections to 2020 suggest a 50 per cent. increase in the proportion of jobs demanding high-level skills and a marked decrease in the number of jobs open to those with low-level skills.<a name="stpa_o21"></a><a name="80114-0004.htm_para5"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Ed Balls"--><a name="0801142000167"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="657"-->Raising the education participation age is not just about economic strength; it is about social justice. Fewer than half of people with no qualifications are in work, young people who leave education or training at 16 are disproportionately from poor families and those who stay in education are more likely to gain further qualifications and earn more. If we do not act now to increase participation, it is the most disadvantaged young people who will be the losers in this new and fast-changing world.<a name="st_o104"></a><a name="0801142000168"></a>

However, in the past five years there has been a faster rise in results for children on free school meals than the average, so we are making a difference.

Despite the rise in participation that we have seen in recent years—participation at 16 has been rising—it is still the case that we have one of the lowest rates of staying on in education or training at 17 of any country in the developed world. It is the third lowest in the western world. Many countries and provinces throughout the world are already raising the education participation age or preparing to do so. In the Netherlands, since August last year, education has been obligatory until 18. In Western Australia, the leaving age was raised from 15 to 16 in 2006 and to 17 this year. In New Brunswick in Canada, the education-leaving age is 18.

If the Bill does anything, it tackles that core issue. I compliment the Secretary of State on doing that. However, one of the biggest issues that I do not believe is addressed in the Bill, and I would like him to respond to this, is that of the guidance we give young people, particularly at key stage 3, so that they go into the right pathways.

There will be extensive opportunity for debate over the coming weeks as the Bill is discussed in detail in Committee, but today I want to make it clear that, in the Government's view, it is only by requiring that every young person participate in education or training until the age of 18 that we can ensure that they all have the opportunities they need and that all employers, schools and colleges are galvanised to play their part so that no young person falls through the cracks.<a name="stpa_o26"></a><a name="80114-0004.htm_para10"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Ed Balls"--><a name="0801142000197"></a>

The first argument that I would deploy is unashamedly personal. No one in my family had gone to university, and both my parents left school early. I know how education can transform opportunities. I would never want any child to lose out on opportunity through a lack of parental resources—that is where the EMA comes in—through a failure of schools to raise aspiration, which is where Connexions can come in, or through a cultural resistance to learning among a child's peers or within his or her community.

At the moment, educational opportunity is unequally distributed. Contrary to the impression given by the Secretary of State in his speech, figures that we excavated over the Christmas period show that the gap between the academic performance in the most advantaged 10 per cent. of schools and that in the least advantaged 10 per cent. has grown and is growing. It is a source of deep concern to us that that should be so. Work by the Sutton Trust and others has confirmed the melancholy correlation between deprivation and academic achievement. We believe that there needs to be a concerted drive to tackle that unfairness and to extend opportunity. We can do that by tackling illiteracy and innumeracy in the earliest years. That, once again, will open up the prospect of academic excellence to many, many more.<a name="stpa_o49"></a><a name="80114-0006.htm_para4"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Michael Gove"--><a name="0801142000251"></a>

They found jobs in sweatshops, retail, low-level commerce and other unskilled or low-skilled environments. Yet within 100 years or so—the space of two or three generations—that community has reached a point where it sends 80 per cent. of its young people to university. That community, the Jewish community, is—in education, as in so many other areas—an example to us all.

As well as personal conviction and social justice, economic imperatives, too, drive the case for greater participation in education. The Leitch report, to which the Secretary of State referred, is the latest in a long line of analyses of Britain's educational underperformance. With specific reference to vocational skills, we have had reports on educational underperformance going right back to 1868.<a name="stpa_o53"></a><a name="80114-0006.htm_para8"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Michael Gove"--><a name="0801142000257"></a>

I myself am wary about predicting with such uncanny precision the specific demand for particular types of labour in an open marketplace in 14 years' time. Some economists argue that the labour market of the future will be much more fluid than Lord Leitch envisages. However, I very much agree with the broader point that the more highly skilled and the better educated our work force—all other things being equal, as I was taught to say in my higher economics—the higher our overall productivity will be.<a name="st_o162"></a><a name="0801142000258"></a>

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="672"-->I should add one other rider to the economic arguments in favour of increasing educational participation. There are those who argue that educational achievement is primarily a positional good—a way of demarcating people's position in a hierarchy so as to secure a better reward proportionate to that of those below them. Those who make that argument contend that qualifications are basically a way of separating sheep from goats. I reject that case. I believe that the more people who have acquired meaningful qualifications, the better. There should be no arbitrary cap on the number who might acquire any qualification, and the creation of communities and a society in which learning is highly valued and knowledge widely dispersed is enriching for everyone.<a name="st_o166"></a><a name="0801142000264"></a>

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="673"-->The Bill places a new duty specifically on 16 and 17-year-olds to participate in education or training. In that respect, as I am sure that the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Cardiff, West (Kevin Brennan) understands, it is qualitatively different from previous historic changes to the school leaving age. When previous changes were made—all, it must be said, by majority Conservative Administrations—the duty rested on parents to ensure that their children were being educated, and for very good reasons. Governments were legislating to protect children from the pressures—economic, social, cultural or whatever—which might have drawn them out of school prematurely. Those Conservative Governments, and their Liberal allies and supporters—I should say, for the benefit of the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) that we are talking about history: I refer to Conservative Governments and their then Liberal allies and supporters—they recognised that children were not yet in a position to decide on their own future. They had not yet reached an age at which they could freely consent to a particular course of action, so they needed to be shielded. The law ensured that no child could be pressurised out of education before being ready to make the decision for himself. That was a protective measure.<a name="stpa_o59"></a><a name="80114-0006.htm_para14"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Michael Gove"--><a name="0801142000273"></a>

Indeed, I learned at the weekend that it is now the age at which the Leader of the House would like young people to vote for the first time. It is therefore ironic—I put it no more strongly—that just as social trends are moving towards giving individuals more freedom, autonomy and respect at 16, the Government propose to deny freedom and autonomy in respect of education or employment, and the Government recognise that.<a name="st_o172"></a><a name="0801142000274"></a>

We have to show increasing respect for the autonomy of young people, and 16 is increasingly an age at which we recognise that that autonomy can be exercised. We recognise that we have a sliding scale of freedoms and entitlements at different ages—17 for driving, and 18 for voting and, as the hon.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="677"-->I should refer at this stage to one curious consequence of what is proposed. Under this legislation, young people will be considered to be in education only if they are studying for a QCA-recognised qualification. A number of independent schools, and others, are currently dissatisfied with the curriculum and are developing, or have developed, their own qualifications and examinations, such as the iGCSE and the Cambridge pre-U. If a young person were studying for those qualifications, with their parents' permission and in a respectable school, would that mean that they were breaking the law? Would that mean, for example, that the whole top stream at Winchester were criminals?<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I know that there are some Labour Members who think the very existence of a top stream at Winchester is inherently criminal, but in drawing attention to that potential anomaly I just wanted to emphasise the potential existence of many flaws and many potential restrictions on liberty in the Bill. What about individuals who want to join and play for sporting teams? What about those who have obtained qualifications and wish to enjoy a gap year travelling or volunteering? We will seek clarification of every area in Committee, and if we receive satisfaction from the Government we will be delighted.<a name="stpa_o72"></a><a name="80114-0007.htm_para7"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Michael Gove"--><a name="0801142000311"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="677"-->My third test is how effective the Government's proposals are likely to be in practice. I have expressed my scepticism that compulsion, as the Government are proceeding with it, is quite the best way to secure the greatest level of fruitful participation in education. It is<br><meta name="Date" content="14 Jan 2008"><notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_678"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 678</b><br>said in the Army that a volunteer is worth 10 pressed men. It is an old saw, but we all know that you can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make it drink. More broadly, anyone involved in education will know that an effective precondition for successful teaching is a willingness on the part of the student to learn. The presence of sullen conscripts in a classroom or learning setting, who resent being there, is unlikely to lead to their sudden conversion to the joys of learning, particularly if their previous experience of learning has been unhappy. Indeed, their presence is unlikely to be conducive to creating a calm and purposeful environment for all those who do want to learn. Given the present high levels of truancy pre-16, with the numbers increasing every year from year 8, the task of enforcing attendance post-16 will certainly be a challenge. The priority should be to ensure that we can provide the right incentives and encouragements to persuade young people to participate in education for as long as possible.<a name="stpa_o73"></a><a name="80114-0007.htm_para8"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Michael Gove"--><a name="0801142000312"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="678"-->The Government have sometimes appeared to believe that any questions about their preferred method of proceeding spring from bad faith or some reactionary desire to limit opportunity, but the range of voices raised in connection with the proposal makes nonsense of any such thought. From the British Youth Council to the Children's Rights Alliance and from Rainer to the Edge foundation, organisations that exist to champion young people's rights and to provide a better vocational education for all have concerns. They all point out that unless disaffection is tackled before 16, the Government's strategy will not succeed, and that an approach based on coercion will be less successful than one that places incentives at its heart.<a name="stpa_o74"></a><a name="80114-0007.htm_para9"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Michael Gove"--><a name="0801142000313"></a>

Custody for under-18s is the one measure that will not be open to the courts as a means of fine enforcement. However, short of custody, a range of options is on offer.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="682"-->On ensuring that participation is maximised, I have pointed out the weaknesses so far in the case being made for the Government's strategy. There are others as well. We know that the Government are committed to increasing the number of apprenticeships. We also know, however, that apprenticeships offered by private sector organisations such as BT are massively oversubscribed, whereas apprenticeships sponsored by the Government, sadly, do not have the same completion levels. Unless the Government can improve their vocational offerings—unless they can make apprenticeships more attractive, increase the workplace element and ensure that they become a better route to work for those who take them—there will still be insufficient incentive for many young people to pursue what could, in the right hands, be a very attractive course.<a name="stpa_o87"></a><a name="80114-0008.htm_para3"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Michael Gove"--><a name="0801142000346"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="682"-->Perhaps this is a matter for Committee, but we are anxious to ensure that increased participation is the goal. We recognise that international comparisons can teach us much, but in the economy most similar to ours, Australia—in both Western Australia and Queensland—people can satisfy the terms of the legislation by continuing to work full-time without training. It would be interesting to hear the Government's arguments why an individual in fruitful employment who might wish to postpone training until after 18 should be criminalised. I am sure that the Government have an answer; I look forward to hearing it. One of our key concerns is that the Bill may price 16 and 17-year-olds out of the marketplace as a result of the costs of compliance, because every firm that hires them will have to monitor where they are when they go to college and find a replacement for them during the 20 per cent. of the working week when they are not there. The additional costs will be considerable. As I pointed out earlier, the CBI argues that firms offering valuable work opportunities will be discouraged from offering jobs by the duties to police participation.<a name="st_o217"></a><a name="0801142000347"></a>

It is specifically concerned that the new duties may deter employers from employing young people, and it argues that the jobs may go to older individuals or people from other countries. As my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Binley) pointed out, the CBI represents larger firms. They may be able to absorb the costs, but 80 per cent. of 16 and 17-year-olds work in smaller firms, where it will be more difficult to do so. We must therefore ensure that any regulation of small business is as light-touch as possible.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="683"-->I have a strong personal involvement in the Bill, and I pressed the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove) on the age at which someone ceases to be a child and becomes an adult, because it is an important point. I have always believed—Opposition Members, including Front Benchers, who have served on the Select Committees that I have chaired know that I passionately believe in this—that a child is still a child until 18. Every child matters, and the outcomes of Every Child Matters should apply to every young person until they are 18. There is a great danger in society of our diminishing the number of years during which a child is considered to be a child. There is a serious challenge, and I agree with some of the voices that suggest that childhood is shrinking: we want children to develop earlier, to go to school and formal lessons earlier; indeed, we want to make them adults before they have the experience and judgment to become adults. I, for one, would not vote to reduce the age of suffrage to 16.<a name="stpa_o90"></a><a name="80114-0008.htm_para6"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Barry Sheerman"--><a name="08011447000003"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="683"-->There has been a long campaign on Leitch. Lord Leitch's review of skills is an important document, and running through it are two strands that we all consider important. First, an individual's potential should be fully exploited, and we should be able to extend the period of time in which they find what they are good at, and discover what qualities they have and apply them. They cannot do so without extremely good help and advice, and the more inquiries the Children, Schools and Families Committee and its predecessor carried out, the more I realised that the quality of teaching and advice that young people receive during their development is important. To be fair, individual potential and its fulfilment are what brought most of us into the House. In my generation, I saw the waste of many people with whom I went to school—and I<br><meta name="Date" content="14 Jan 2008"><notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_684"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 684</b><br>suspect that you did, too, Madam Deputy Speaker— who did not have my opportunities.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="684"-->A secondary aspect of Leitch is the fact that we want a more effective and prosperous economy and society. The more educated people are, the less prone they are to criminal and antisocial behaviour; the more they tend to volunteer; and the more they become multidimensional members of society, which is what we want. To develop Marcuse's concept, it is not one-dimensional man, but multidimensional men and women whom we should seek to produce.<a name="stpa_o92"></a><a name="80114-0008.htm_para8"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Barry Sheerman"--><a name="08011447000005"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="684"-->My personal involvement goes back to May when, supported by some Members who are in the House this afternoon, I introduced a private Member's Bill; one of the hon. Members who supported that Bill is sitting on the Opposition Front Bench today. We tried in a different way, because it was a private Member's Bill, to change what happens to young people at 16 and to introduce a system of proper assessment running through to 16. Under that Bill, there would have been a proper assessment at 16 of the abilities and potential of young people. Even today there is still the possibility of people just fading away from education. They may have some exam results, but what is needed is a full evaluation of what they have contributed not just academically but to the life of the school and to their own development. That still does not exist. This Bill may move us in that direction.<a name="stpa_o93"></a><a name="80114-0008.htm_para9"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Barry Sheerman"--><a name="08011447000006"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="684"-->I hope that hon. Members on both sides of the House will remember that this is a Bill to promote the idea of young people staying in education, training or work-based learning until 18.

There is plenty of scope. There are some real problems around that; we would be daft if we did not accept that.

When the Prime Minister was still Chancellor of the Exchequer, I once told him that I wanted a life coach and a personal trainer for every young person in the country.

I have worked with her over the years on a number of issues and have much respect for her, but she and I disagree fundamentally about the Bill. However, that does not mean that we should not take her qualifications seriously. I wish she had not published her recent paper for Policy Exchange, which is well known for leaning to the right of British politics. Her report would have had more credibility if it had been published elsewhere. However, that does not gainsay the fact that she is a highly respected academic and we should take her worries and concerns seriously. But hers is not the only research; I would like it to have been published in a more academic context because an academic paper is published after peer review and gives a much more thoughtful look at the relevant issue.<a name="stpa_o102"></a><a name="80114-0008.htm_para18"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Sheerman"--><a name="08011447000021"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="686"-->We have time to look at and meet Alison Wolf's concerns in the coming period. One of the things that she harks on about a little that particularly worries me is the sort of analysis that we had when we introduced the minimum wage. People said that it would restrict employers, and I heard echoes of that from Conservative Front Benchers today. As my hon. Friends will remember, when we discussed the minimum wage, before the hon. Member for Surrey Heath came to the House, there were voices saying that it would be such a regulatory change that we were going to force people out of business and that small businesses would suffer, although big businesses would cope. That counsel of despair has not turned out to be true. It is also a counsel of despair to say that small businesses do not benefit from highly trained and skilled workers; we all do. The challenge is that we have moved to a much more highly skilled and competitive local and international economy. People expect higher standards all the time in everything—in health,<br><meta name="Date" content="14 Jan 2008"><notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_687"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 687</b><br>education and retailing. There have to be higher standards in every possible area of life, and that means people trained to a higher level.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="687"-->Wolf and others whom I have heard in recent days and weeks ignore the fact that there has been an increasingly rapid and fundamental change in what is happening in 14-to-19 education. There are a large number of students between the ages of 14 and 16 at further education colleges today. More and more such young people are partly in work experience, partly at FE college and perhaps only based at school. That has been a real change. Education for 14 to 19-year-olds is also changing rapidly. Apprenticeships are vital and we must expand them. Work-based learning is also so important.

I am not quite sure what point the Secretary of State was seeking to make. Nobody doubts that individuals aged 14 are children, and back in 1916 the voting age was 21.

Some of the statistics right across the country, particularly in the most deprived communities, show just how far away we are from giving people genuine educational opportunities at 16 and beyond. For example, the latest figures published by the Government show that, on the basis of their own chosen measure—the number of youngsters who get five A* to C GCSEs, including English and maths 84 per cent. of white British boys from poor families are failing to get those qualifications. We need to think about why there is such a chasm of educational disadvantage between those in the more affluent areas and those in deprived areas.<br><meta name="Date" content="14 Jan 2008"><notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_689"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 689</b><br><a name="st_o235"></a><a name="08011447000037"></a>

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="690"-->I would like to start not with the practical issues related to the Bill, which are extremely important to my party, but with the issue of principle. The Bill will extend state control over many people in a significant way. It will certainly do so over 16 and 17-year-olds. It could extend control over parents, although there is confusion, or doubt, in the Government's mind about what responsibilities parents of 16 and 17-year-olds should have. It will certainly extend the obligations on local authorities and employers.

No doubt the Secretary of State will be able to cite others who are in favour of this element of compulsion. However, he could have cited not only the principal Opposition parties as opponents of compulsion and criminalisation, but many other bodies with which his party has been associated in the past—in some cases, the distant past—such as the TUC, the National Union of Teachers, the Children's Society, the Professional Association of Teachers and the Children's Rights Alliance for England.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="690"-->In an earlier response, the Secretary of State did not do justice to the serious issue of the way in which we treat 16 and 17-year-olds in our society. They are not treated completely as individuals with adult rights, but they have many of the rights of adults. They have the power to start work, get married, be parents, or change their name; they are allowed to be pilots, to gamble, to join a trade union, to leave home and to apply for a passport. The Government are now, as the hon. Member for Surrey Heath said earlier, and as I implied in my question, proposing to give young people the vote at 16.<a name="stpa_o117"></a><a name="80114-0009.htm_para11"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Laws"--><a name="08011447000049"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="690"-->One wonders what the ideology is of a Government who think that young people of 16 or 17 should have the power to vote and determine the future of our country, as the Labour party does, but who also manage to hold the idea that those young people are not equipped to make judgments about their own best interests in education and training. There is an inconsistency in the Government's approach and in their attitude towards liberty that I assume must reflect a confusion in their view of the age at which young people can be considered adults. I presume that the Secretary of State was not saying that if the CBI decided it would be advantageous for young people to be in education until the ages of 19, 20 or 21, the Government would consider legislating to force people to stay in education beyond even the age of 18. I assume that a confusion about when one acquires adult rights is behind that aspect of the Bill.<br><meta name="Date" content="14 Jan 2008"><notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_691"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 691</b><br><a name="stpa_o118"></a><a name="80114-0009.htm_para12"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Laws"--><a name="08011447000050"></a>

I also suggest to the Secretary of State not only that the Government are not yet able to keep all the youngsters whom they would like to in education until even the age of 16, but that he would be hard pressed to find any other country in the world, including those where there is compulsion, where all those in the age cohort up to 18 are in education and training.<a name="st_o241"></a><a name="08011447000051"></a>

We know who these people are; we do not have to guess. They are often from highly disadvantaged backgrounds and will often have secured few or no qualifications. They might well already have a history of truancy; the truancy figures are extremely high in schools in many parts of the country, which is relevant to the issue that we are discussing.

There is a whole issue about how we should deal with people aged 16 or 17 who have had a child, and we shall no doubt come back to that in Committee.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="693"-->Alison Wolf's excellent paper, to which the Chairman of the Select Committee referred earlier, lists in one of its later chapters a whole series of schemes—some of them Government-backed—with a proven record of having real benefits in tackling educational disadvantage early. She says:<a name="80114-0009.htm_brev4"></a><a name="08011447000175"></a><ul><p class="tabletext">“There is no need to settle for an education policy with such poor outcomes.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="693"-->which has a well-proven record in dealing with educational disadvantage. She also talks about the funding of tuition in English as a second language, and about ensuring that there is an educational entitlement to the two additional years of education or training, which people will be able to take at a more flexible time. I shall return to that last point in a moment.<a name="stpa_o127"></a><a name="80114-0009.htm_para21"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Laws"--><a name="08011447000069"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="693"-->The hon. Member for Surrey Heath touched on another proposal that would tackle disadvantage, which, sadly, the Government have yet to take up, and that is the pupil premium. I am glad that the Conservatives are showing some sympathy with this idea, although I am not sure that that sympathy has yet been illustrated by the shadow Chancellor providing any money to fund the proposal. Frankly, a pupil premium policy with no funding associated with it will not be effective in challenging educational disadvantage. A question that we can legitimately ask the Government is whether it is right to bring in this draconian extension of Government powers over individuals, their families and businesses without having done much more to invest in those areas and without having put in place a coherent structure for the curriculum and qualifications which meets the needs of these young people.<a name="stpa_o128"></a><a name="80114-0010.htm_para0"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Laws"--><a name="08011447000070"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="693"-->The second issue for Ministers is why the Government have rejected the idea of adopting a similar course in terms of aspiration, while building in more freedom and flexibility by making this an entitlement rather than an obligation at 16 to 18. It is absolutely right to see it as unacceptable that the most affluent youngsters in our society should have free<br><meta name="Date" content="14 Jan 2008"><notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_694"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 694</b><br>education right from the age of three or four up to 18—with potentially further subsidies beyond that in higher education—when many of the most disadvantaged leave the education system at 16 without having the ability to draw down on that funding.<a name="st_o251"></a><a name="08011447000071"></a>

The hon. Gentleman talks about extending a flexible entitlement, but has he not noticed that the Bill establishes a statutory right for funding for a first level 2 qualification throughout working life, and, indeed, a statutory right to funding for a level 3 qualification for those who are not in work up to the age of 25? The Bill thus goes considerably beyond a focus on 16 to 18-year-olds by establishing the very type of lifelong entitlement that the hon. Gentleman is asking for.<a name="st_o252"></a><a name="08011447000072"></a>

I welcome those very sensible aspects of the Bill, but it is clear from Alison Wolf's report and from talking to people in the further education sector that there are some flexibilities and freedoms in respect of these entitlements that could be dealt with far more fully in the Bill, so we will seek to amend it to deal with that problem.<a name="stpa_o129"></a><a name="80114-0010.htm_para1"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Laws"--><a name="08011447000073"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="694"-->I put to the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills a point put to me by many head teachers in my constituency. In expressing their views of the Bill, many of them told me that many among this small core of young people with multiple disadvantages are very difficult to engage in education beyond 16; indeed, they may have left school or disengaged completely by that age. They are the type of people we can easily end up chasing through the courts for ever and getting nowhere. However, I have been struck by how many of the same head teachers have told me that they often see the same youngsters later on in their lives—at 18, 19 and 20—much readier to engage with education and much readier to benefit from it. We will want to ensure—I believe that this is the Secretary of State's point—that those individuals have every freedom and opportunity to take up their chances then, when they are ready for it, rather than being forced down a course at 16 in order to allow the Government to publish a set of tables with a zero figure.<a name="stpa_o130"></a><a name="80114-0010.htm_para2"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Laws"--><a name="08011447000074"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="694"-->My former noble Friend Earl Russell, now sadly deceased, often commented in the other place on the extent to which Government legislation, particularly top-down legislation, does not deal with the world as it is in its full complexity and richness, as we try to legislate for large categories of people without thinking about the reality on the ground. When we return in Committee to the list of people likely to fall into this category, I hope that we can deal with their real circumstances, acknowledge the extent to which they may find it genuinely difficult to engage at 16 or 17 and provide them with some real choices.<a name="stpa_o131"></a><a name="80114-0010.htm_para3"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Laws"--><a name="08011447000075"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="694"-->I have other practical concerns, some of which are similar to those expressed by the hon. Member for Surrey Heath. I hope that we can discuss this issue seriously in Committee. I noticed the Minister for Schools and Learners nodding in recognition of the point earlier, although he was doubtless not conceding<br><meta name="Date" content="14 Jan 2008"><notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_695"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 695</b><br>anything by doing so. Although the bigger employers organisations can already easily supply accredited education and training for youngsters in their employment—often to a very high standard indeed—there may well be youngsters of 16 or 17 who find education a totally unrewarding experience and have no interest in engaging with it.<a name="stpa_o132"></a><a name="80114-0010.htm_para4"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Laws"--><a name="08011447000076"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="695"-->We saw earlier that in respect of accessing education, there are also huge transport gaps in some parts of the country. Youngsters there might be in employment that we would consider to be low-skill, and they might not be getting accreditation for it, but it might be teaching them valuable disciplines and it might lead to accreditation later. In trying, for the best of reasons, to ensure that those people have accredited qualifications, we need to be careful that we do not drive them out of the labour market and discover, as the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) indicated earlier, that their jobs are taken by many of the extremely energetic and effective economic migrants who are increasingly coming here from other parts of the European Union.<a name="stpa_o133"></a><a name="80114-0010.htm_para5"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Laws"--><a name="08011447000077"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="695"-->In relation to the exchange between the Chairman of the Children, Schools and Families Committee and the right hon. Member for Birkenhead, it is useful to note the suggestion in Alison Wolf's report that the figures that the Government often cite about the small demand for people with no or low qualifications in the future are not based, as I understand it, on an estimate of what the demands will be, but on estimates of how many people in the labour force will have no qualifications, which is a totally different thing.<a name="stpa_o134"></a><a name="80114-0010.htm_para6"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Laws"--><a name="08011447000078"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="695"-->My final point is on the assessment of costs and benefits contained in the documents published with the Bill. The paper that Alison Wolf has produced challenges the Government's cost-benefit analysis, which has alleged benefits for each cohort of about £2.4 billion. She suggests that the figures are grossly optimistic and that the range of possibilities is centred around the measures not having a net benefit but potentially a cost. As we consider the Bill in Committee, I hope that we will scrutinise the Government's assumptions closely, because if Alison Wolf is correct to say that the cost-benefit analysis of the proposals is unduly optimistic, some of the other educational proposals that I mentioned earlier might have a far greater effect.<a name="st_o253"></a><a name="08011447000079"></a>

As a Bill of this kind obviously requires cross-party approval if it is to achieve its ambitions, I am very pleased that neither of the main Opposition parties will oppose its Second Reading.

We all agree that skills are vital, and Lord Leitch's report crystallised that national consensus, but I am less preoccupied with his target of the attainment of graduate status by 40 per cent. of the population than with those at the bottom end of the scale. All who have spoken so far have stressed that our real problem is the 20 per cent. who still leave school at 16 with no skills, although we have considerably increased the percentage of people who gain GCSEs. I cannot remember what the figure was before, but it is now about 71 per cent. If we are to make sense of this opportunity we must refocus our attentions as a nation through social policy, taxation policy and, not least, the education system itself.<a name="stpa_o137"></a><a name="80114-0010.htm_para9"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Geoffrey Robinson"--><a name="08011447000086"></a>

I mean no disrespect to the civil servants concerned when I say that given the huge amounts that we spend on skills—some £11 billion a year, £7 billion being spent by the Department for Children, Schools and Families and £4 billion by the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills—we are not receiving anything like the return that we should receive.<a name="st_o258"></a><a name="08011447000087"></a>

We simply do not have the experience of successful policies to solve the terrible problem of under-achievement and the absence of skills among 20 per cent. of youngsters leaving school. That is a scar on the national conscience, and on our competence to spend money. The money is there. It is not a question of piling in more money, which I think would be the worst thing we could do.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="697"-->The fact that the Government have made continuing education a statutory requirement for the children concerned, with all the problems to which that may lead, is not my preoccupation today. I want to focus on how we can make the Bill a success in the next five years, not on how we can get it through the House. The Government have entered into a statutory obligation to make apprenticeships available to all those going through the school system—particularly those aged between 16 and 18—who have met the minimum requirements. At this point, I see no real prospect of the Government's making that legal engagement a reality.<a name="stpa_o139"></a><a name="80114-0010.htm_para11"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Geoffrey Robinson"--><a name="08011447000090"></a>

I do not know the precise numbers—I do not think they have been published—but I know that in 2005-06 there were 155,000 apprenticeships, an increase of about 1 per cent. on the previous year. As was observed in the other place, we are now seeking to increase the proportion of 16 to18-year-olds in apprenticeships from 7 or 8 per cent. to 20 per cent. in five years.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="698"-->I have a suggestion, which may or may not be appropriate for inclusion in amendments or new clauses in Committee. I propose, merely for consideration, that we remove the task from the Departments, although of course progress would be reported to them. What we need is a national apprenticeships service headed by someone with real fire in his or her belly, whose life would be dedicated to delivering this obligation. The service could be carved out of the Learning and Skills Council—I do not care where it comes from—but it should have its own budget and report very clearly to both Secretaries of State, as well as reporting annually to the House. It should state its progress towards achieving the Government's five-year objective. No doubt many objections will be raised to my proposal, but I think that the Government should give it fair consideration. If we can find the right people to be members of the organisation, give it a budget and allow it freedom to go out and do the things that are necessary, there may be some hope of our achieving the target.<a name="stpa_o142"></a><a name="80114-0010.htm_para14"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Geoffrey Robinson"--><a name="08011447000093"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="698"-->Two fundamental things are necessary. First, we must re-establish a decent counselling and advisory service for schools. I do not want to go into the history of what happened to the old service, and I have not followed it in great detail, but those who have done so will confirm that it collapsed, and under this and earlier Governments has not been restored to anything like the required level. Secondly, we shall need a proselytising effort by businesses. I do not mean just the large companies, although the hon. Member for Surrey Heath mentioned BT, which has a fantastic apprenticeship scheme. The big companies can certainly do more, but we need action through the CBI, the British Chambers of Commerce and the Federation of Small Businesses—serious action throughout the country.<a name="stpa_o143"></a><a name="80114-0010.htm_para15"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Geoffrey Robinson"--><a name="08011447000094"></a>

Our starting point should be the establishment of the counselling and advisory service, but there should also be work among industries, small and big, and in schools.<a name="stpa_o144"></a><a name="80114-0010.htm_para16"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Geoffrey Robinson"--><a name="08011447000095"></a>

It is as well that the Government understand that there is widespread scepticism throughout the country—in industry and in schools—about whether we can make this a success. I think that everyone in this House would agree that we are talking about a good aspiration, and nobody could say that we should not attempt to achieve it.

Friend the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills is responsible for those up to 24, and the great success of the Train to Gain scheme is testimony that we have done better in that area. However, we will never cope with the major problem of children leaving school with no qualifications by Train to Gain. We must tackle the problem, as we did when we first came into government, with the primary schools. If we want to improve secondary education on an ongoing basis, we must start with the primary schools. If we want to get this unemployment thing right, we must get it right in the secondary schools. I have mentioned counselling, but it is no good people having it at 16—it must start at 14. The children must see a meaningful link between what they do in school and a job that they will get. They must say, “That is a clear link. If I pursue it, I will succeed.”<a name="stpa_o149"></a><a name="80114-0010.htm_para21"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Geoffrey Robinson"--><a name="08011447000100"></a>

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="701"-->The Government know that we are all failing too many of our young people. Despite the increased money available to them, schools are unable to achieve what we want them to achieve for the pupils. Far too many pupils still leave school at 16 without A* to C grades in English and maths, and it is worrying that we camouflage some of our figures by boasting about GCSE improvements that include attainment in other subjects, but exclude maths and English. I have already highlighted the fact that my borough has a mixed provision of excellent secondary schools, which includes grammar, Church, comprehensive and technical schools, as well as academies, but even there some issues of concern remain.<a name="stpa_o158"></a><a name="80114-0011.htm_para5"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. David Evennett"--><a name="08011447000110"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="701"-->I must also point out that the Government discriminate against my borough, in comparison with other London boroughs, in terms of dedicated schools grant—only Bromley and Havering received less money per pupil this year. That discrimination is regrettable and acts as a local disincentive. I wish to put on record the tremendous work done by the Bexley council cabinet members, Simon Windle and Teresa O'Neill, and congratulate them on the tremendous job that they are doing in our borough. Although it is a good borough that aims to help everyone to achieve, the statistics show that 5.2 per cent. of 16-year-olds in Bexley left school in 2005 and entered full-time employment, but 8.2 per cent. who left in that year were not in education, employment or training. The Bexley Business Academy was among the 200 worst schools for children staying on for post-16 education. That is most worrying and a betrayal of our young people. Therefore we have to do more in the future to ensure that our children get a better education.<a name="stpa_o159"></a><a name="80114-0011.htm_para6"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. David Evennett"--><a name="08011447000111"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="701"-->The Bill proposes to force all pupils to stay in education or training until they reach 18. I do not like the word “force”. We should not aim for compulsion, but to encourage and enthuse people. When we look back to the 1970s and the raising of the school leaving age, many children were forced to stay on an extra year. The Secretary of State pointed out that the Bill would not force them to stay at school, but it will force them to stay in education or training. There were problems in the 1970s with attendance and discipline among those who did not want to stay on at school and who were angry and disaffected, and wanted to leave as soon as possible. I was teaching at the time in a grammar school, and even there some boys wanted to leave school as soon as possible and made it harder for others in the class to learn and made life difficult for teachers. Those boys did not want to be there and they were already disengaged from the system.<a name="stpa_o160"></a><a name="80114-0011.htm_para7"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. David Evennett"--><a name="08011447000112"></a>

Intervention is needed much earlier, and we should be encouraging and developing children at primary school and as they pass to secondary school. When they are 16 it is too late, and they should have counselling and other involvement at 14 to encourage them to realise that if they do not get the qualifications their lives will not be as fulfilled as they could be.<a name="stpa_o161"></a><a name="80114-0011.htm_para8"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. David Evennett"--><a name="08011447000113"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="702"-->I am very concerned about indiscipline and truancy increasing if pupils are forced to stay on at school. If they are forced to stay on, it may lead to the same problems as we saw in the 1970s with the raising of the school leaving age. I therefore have severe doubts about this approach. The very people whom the Bill will target are already troubled, under performing, disengaged, vulnerable or damaged. Surely the best way to get children to remain in school is to be inspirational and encouraging, and to start much earlier.<a name="stpa_o162"></a><a name="80114-0011.htm_para9"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. David Evennett"--><a name="08011447000114"></a>

For example, some people would want to leave school early to pursue a sporting career.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="702"-->It is all very well to be dismissive, but we should be constructive. There is much in the Bill that we support. It is fundamental that everybody has the basics of reading, writing and arithmetic. If there are failings, we should intervene much earlier in the school system. We need to reform the testing regime in primary schools, so that we reduce bureaucracy and focus on the pupils' real needs to deal with them constructively much earlier.<a name="stpa_o164"></a><a name="80114-0011.htm_para11"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. David Evennett"--><a name="08011447000116"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="702"-->We should also champion excellence, and there are some tremendous comprehensive schools that evangelise the best professional practice in the state system. We should more generously reward those who deliver for the poorest. It is essential that the most disadvantaged should be assisted even more, and we will need to debate how that can be done in Committee. We need change, but we do not need compulsion. We need to improve discipline and behaviour in schools and shift the balance of power in every classroom back in favour of the teacher. We should deliver more teaching by ability, which strengthens the strongest and nurtures the weakest.<a name="stpa_o165"></a><a name="80114-0011.htm_para12"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. David Evennett"--><a name="08011447000117"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="702"-->There are tremendous opportunities to work together constructively, as we have seen in today's debate. Many good points have been made, but I have many questions still to ask. I am especially concerned about the quality and relevance of education, rather than the quantity. The belief that the longer someone stays in education the better they will be equipped for life is questionable. It is quality that we seek.<a name="stpa_o166"></a><a name="80114-0011.htm_para13"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. David Evennett"--><a name="08011447000118"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="702"-->The Bill provides some tremendous opportunities. It is very constructive, and it should have support on both sides of the House. I am encouraged by what I have heard, but I repeat that I do not think that compulsion is right. We should encourage and intervene much earlier, before 16, to ensure that youngsters who leave school without qualifications and the equipment that they will need for life are dealt with much earlier. That approach would be more successful.<br><meta name="Date" content="14 Jan 2008"><notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_703"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 703</b><br><a name="ordayhd_7"></a><a name="80114-0011.htm_ordayhd0"></a><a name="08011447000184"></a><h5 align="left">6.16 pm</h5><a name="st_o261"></a><a name="08011447000119"></a>

We are immensely proud that the Government are the first ever to undertake to abolish child poverty over a 20-year period. Progress has been made, and although it has stalled somewhat recently, the record is second to none. However, the number of the very poorest has increased. If we consider various health indices, the Government have generally made good progress, but the very poorest in our community are not benefiting equally with other groups. The gap between the very poorest and the rest of us—let alone the rich—is widening. My hon.

However, they go on to secondary school, where many of them fail. We also know that more than five out of 10 of our constituents who leave school at 16 do not get the minimum educational qualifications that the Government want everybody in that age group to get.

I thought that they were highly intelligent. My point was that they posed a challenge not only because they were intelligent but because many of them had not been at school since they were 14; some had not been at school since they were 12.<a name="stpa_o170"></a><a name="80114-0011.htm_para17"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Frank Field"--><a name="08011447000123"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="703"-->In the Bill, we are talking about what we do with young people—whether we call them children or adults—at the age of 16. Although we do well by the majority of children who go through our schools, what makes a mockery of that is our failure to engage with a significant group. That lack of engagement does not arise because they are thick or damaged, but because we are serving a diet of education by which they are deeply bored and quickly failed.<a name="st_o262"></a><a name="08011447000124"></a>

However, I was talking not about that group of children—in no way do I want to detract from what they do—but about those who are so peeved off by education that the last thing in the world that they will do is turn up to school.

It could cover the basic skills in maths, education and IT and, as soon as young people gained the certificate at 14, they would be allowed to leave school provided that they could get a job. At the moment, any moneys that we taxpayers put towards them are wasted. That group should have the £20,000 that we would spend on them between the ages of 14 and 16 if they turned up to school—although they do not—held as a dowry, which they would control. When they realised that it is quite tough out there in the world of work, even if they had a job, they might change their views about wanting to acquire skills.

I asked whether we could not do something different with that £1 million—as we know that there will probably be 38 such young people next year, I asked whether we could have an experiment with a small technical school that might engage their interest. The reply was, “No, we could not possibly do that. We could not teach the national curriculum in a school that size.” I reminded the person who said that that we are not teaching those young people the national curriculum now—so what is the point of pretending? I agree that the aims of the national curriculum were totally proper and have benefited most young people in this country, but they do not benefit most of the young people who do not fit into the box.<a name="stpa_o175"></a><a name="80114-0011.htm_para22"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Frank Field"--><a name="08011447000135"></a>

However, I am worried about compulsion and I share the concern of the hon. Member for Coventry, North-West about apprenticeships and tackling the challenge for this country, which is that approximately 28 per cent. of our people are qualified through apprenticeships or educationally in the crafts and technically, whereas, in our competitor countries, such as France and Germany, the figure is more than 50 per cent.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="706"-->Let me start with the group that the right hon. Member for Birkenhead identified: the poorest in our society, who are not getting the skills that they need. Last year, I visited a range of projects that deal with social exclusion and also some prisons. The average reading age of prisoners is 11. There is a link between those in our society who fail in education and the consequences for them—the fact that they may end up committing crime, unable to work and socially excluded. Some of them also have social problems, which have contributed, and I shall say more about that later.<a name="stpa_o178"></a><a name="80114-0011.htm_para25"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Oliver Heald"--><a name="08011447000141"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="706"-->One of the projects that I visited was Rainer, which does much work with people who have been in prison or lack basic skills. A group there was preparing to learn to read and write so that they could pass their health and safety certificate to work in the building trade. Those people had had more than 12 years of education in which they had not been able to learn to read and write, yet in the group, they were picking it up quickly, as the right hon. Gentleman described. They were not unintelligent; they simply suddenly had a motivation for learning to read and write, and they were going for it and succeeding. What a sad reflection on their 12 years of statutory education that it could not get them to the point of having the basic reading and writing skills to do a manual job for which one needs some education.<a name="stpa_o179"></a><a name="80114-0012.htm_para0"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Oliver Heald"--><a name="08011447000142"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="706"-->I also spent a week working in a direct access homeless hostel, which concentrated on young people. We found people who were very ill through drink and drug abuse and needed a lot of help. However, after a period in the hostel, they improved. They would get to the point where they could move from the hostel into a flat. Their biggest problem at that stage was that they could not budget because they were so innumerate.

It was a male hostel, but I expect the same is true in women's hostels. She did it in approximately a month. Again, those people had had more than 12 years of education in the state system. How can people be in education for that time, with all the money that is spent, yet unable to do basic maths or read and write? When one asks them about their experiences at school, one feels the fear that they felt when they explain that they had not learned to read and write by the time they were seven, and had spent years at the back of a classroom, where they were being taught history, geography or science, keeping their heads down, dreading the teacher turning to them, because they could not understand a word of what was happening.<a name="st_o272"></a><a name="08011447000143"></a>

Evidence that we heard recently in the Work and Pensions Committee suggested that if a person's mother cannot read and write, they are more likely to have problems because they are not getting the back-up at home.

That is a dangerous suggestion and I note that the Professional Association of Teachers said in its response that insisting on two extra years is a worrying way in which to confront young people who have had such an experience.

That is not the way forward. It is odd to read in the Bill an offence of effectively doing oneself harm. Clause 46 provides that, if young people do not follow the attendance orders, they commit an offence of not improving their education. It is an odd idea in a country with liberal values. The Secretary of State says that one would not necessarily go to prison if one did not pay the fine, but the sort of people whom we are discussing have gone year after year without attending school. It is possible that they would get an attendance order, not follow it, commit the offence, be fined and not pay the fine. One of the penalties is going to a young offender institution. The Secretary of State says that the Government are trying to change that so that the young person would go only to an attendance centre. It is still odd to provide such a criminal penalty for an offence that has a civil feel to it.

It is a worry that under the current arrangements about 59 per cent. of those between 16 and 18 do not complete what we now call apprenticeships. Quite large numbers of people do apprenticeships—250,000 at present. The Government would say—I think that the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills might be saying it right now—that they have increased that number substantially, from about 75,000.

That is 1,700 young people or, to extrapolate from those figures, 17,000 in the north-east and more than 325,000 in England. A Labour Government cannot let those young people down. We have the potential to open the floodgates for people's aspirations, and we would be wrong to ignore the signs. According to the survey, seven out of 10 people polled across the generations in Newcastle believe that the biggest long-term benefit of going to university is the ability to get a better job. Some 62 per cent. agree that university education gives people a chance to earn more money, and nearly three quarters of the respondents think that studying a subject that people<br><meta name="Date" content="14 Jan 2008"><notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_712"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 712</b><br>enjoy is a good reason to enter higher education or other training. Feelings of personal well-being and the belief that one is securing the future of one's family should not be the preserve of a privileged few—they should be available to people from all walks of life.<a name="stpa_o195"></a><a name="80114-0012.htm_para16"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Phil Wilson"--><a name="08011447000170"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="712"-->As I have said, the Government's policy on education, skills and access to university is going in the right direction. The Government want people from all walks of life and of all ages to be given the chance to achieve their full potential, and they want to ensure that people are given the best preparation for life that they can possibly receive. I remember the days when parents had to raise funds for exercise books, pens and pencils for their local school—I am pleased to say that that was not under a Labour Government. The Government's approach to education differs from that of other Governments who thought, “You have an education, you keep it and you pull up the ladder on everybody else.” The Bill shows a Government looking to the future and being prepared to make the hard, strategic decisions necessary for the country while addressing the individual aspirations of the majority.<a name="ordayhd_10"></a><a name="80114-0012.htm_ordayhd1"></a><a name="08011454000088"></a><h5 align="left">6.54 pm</h5><a name="st_o284"></a><a name="08011454000001"></a>

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="712"-->I had the good fortune to be an apprentice in the steel industry in the 1970s, when apprenticeships lasted for four years, not two. The quality of that training shone out, and we were the best in the world. In the last six months of those four-year apprenticeships, people completed their training and worked as craftsmen. Without such experience, they could not get a job anywhere else if they could not stay in the industry. Experience does not come off a shelf, and it cannot be found in a book—it comes from doing the job. I am worried that that is missing from the Bill, given the two-year time scale.<a name="stpa_o197"></a><a name="80114-0012.htm_para18"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Dai Davies"--><a name="08011454000003"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="712"-->One of the best things about being a convenor in the steel industry was working with the apprentices and young people. The purpose of that role was inspirational. To develop the point made by the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field), if work in any part of education is not inspirational we lose those individuals. We had difficult times. Although there was a huge selection process, there were still problems with individuals who lost interest in the work. It was not a bed of roses, even when a massive number of people applied for apprenticeships. The loss of manufacturing has resulted in the loss of jobs for life. We heard earlier about the coal and steel industries. In constituencies such as mine, people left school, and went into the steel industry as production or craft apprentices. With the loss of that industry, we have lost core apprentice training. The system that we seek to implement must not be onerous on the employer. If it is, it will fail, as employers will resist it. Companies such as BT have training departments that operate training facilities, but in smaller businesses, it is impossible to do so.<a name="stpa_o198"></a><a name="80114-0012.htm_para19"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Dai Davies"--><a name="08011454000004"></a>

We have heard from Members on both sides of the House about the criminalisation of individuals and employers, and I would certainly vote against measures that imposed such penalties. The growing movement towards the academy system appears to favour degrees. I am not against the attainment of degrees, but some years ago, we had technical colleges that were linked to employers and businesses. They trained people to acquire practical skills, but we have lost a lot of that ability to provide practical training. We are looking at degree courses, but we have moved away from the things that industry needs.<a name="stpa_o199"></a><a name="80114-0012.htm_para20"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Dai Davies"--><a name="08011454000005"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="713"-->The provision of education must be flexible. An innovation that we have looked at in some of the Welsh regions is apprenticeship sharing. Industrial estates provide training centres and more than one employer can buy in to that training. If there is a larger employer on the estate with training facilities, those facilities can be shared. An apprenticeship with a single employer can be onerous, so we should look at shared apprenticeships, and how they can be supported by local authorities and other businesses in area. I spoke earlier about equal opportunities, and we must recognise that people with disabilities face many barriers. Gender is important, too. Traditional industries were always regarded as male bastions. Today, barriers have been broken down in some steelworks, and gender discrimination is a thing of the past.<a name="stpa_o200"></a><a name="80114-0012.htm_para21"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Dai Davies"--><a name="08011454000006"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="713"-->Quality as well as quantity is important. The goal of offering 250,000 apprenticeships is a numbers game, but if someone trains for two years and thinks they are an expert they will find that that is not the case. We need to look at the quality of the training that we provide. As a former school governor in both primary and secondary education, I have seen teachers identify problems with young children not at 16, 15 or 14 but at nine, eight and seven. We need to spread mentoring practice across the education system. We have mentoring in senior schools, but the building blocks are in primary schools. Unless we look at mentoring at that age, we have lost the plot.<a name="stpa_o201"></a><a name="80114-0012.htm_para22"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Dai Davies"--><a name="08011454000007"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="713"-->Family support is extremely important. If a teacher identifies a problem with a child, the likelihood is that the family need help and support with an issue. Education is not just within four walls; it spreads across the whole family and into the community.<a name="stpa_o202"></a><a name="80114-0012.htm_para23"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Dai Davies"--><a name="08011454000008"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="713"-->We have lost an opportunity. Citizenship was introduced as a curriculum item but the way it was introduced has not worked. In most secondary schools that I visit, the citizenship agenda has been lost. It entered like a lion but it is going out like a lamb. I would hate to see this Bill go the same route.<a name="stpa_o203"></a><a name="80114-0012.htm_para24"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Dai Davies"--><a name="08011454000009"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="713"-->The managing of systems of apprenticeships and shared apprenticeships is important, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises. We heard earlier about the multinationals and the bigger industries, but SMEs and smaller businesses may need help.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="714"-->I have a concern about the numbers game. We have spoken about having over 200,000 apprentices. We have also spoken about needing people from other countries to come in to fill skills gaps, so where are the 250,000 apprentices going to go? As we continue to train more and more, will that mean that we will need fewer people coming into the country? How do we balance the books?<a name="stpa_o206"></a><a name="80114-0013.htm_para2"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Dai Davies"--><a name="08011454000012"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="714"-->My area suffered from a steelworks closure some six years ago. An American gentleman by the name of Leo Schostack came in to help to regenerate the area. The statement he made about the area was that it was inspirational but we did not know it. That point was important. The way out of poverty is through education, but we need that inspirational element of education to get young people interested. To force them down a route is the wrong way to go.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="714"-->I warmly welcome the introduction of the Bill. I believe that, at their root, its proposals will be very good for young people and good for our economy. The Bill will give more young people the opportunity to take part in learning and, crucially, training, beyond the age of 16, giving them more options, and more time to learn and to develop skills.<a name="stpa_o208"></a><a name="80114-0013.htm_para4"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Joan Ryan"--><a name="08011454000015"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="714"-->The logic is clear. Young people will have more opportunity to fulfil their potential and a more widely skilled population will be good for our employers, because it will help us to increase productivity and capacity for innovation. That in turn will boost our economy at home and in the world, and help us to achieve world-class skills by 2020.<a name="stpa_o209"></a><a name="80114-0013.htm_para5"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Joan Ryan"--><a name="08011454000016"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="714"-->We in Britain currently have one of the lowest rates of staying on at the age of 17 in developed countries, and at any one time around 10 per cent. of our young people are classed as NEETs: not in education, employment or training. That is a matter that must be tackled, and we have a duty to do that. It is my view that this Bill will go a long way to help address that issue and I welcome it on that basis.<a name="stpa_o210"></a><a name="80114-0013.htm_para6"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Joan Ryan"--><a name="08011454000017"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="714"-->By creating a Bill in which young people will have access to learning in a range of ways, be it through traditional academic education, or on-the-job apprenticeships, the Bill raises the status of work-based learning and vocational education, bringing it on to a par with academic education. That is long overdue and necessary. That is an important step in raising our skills level and young people's self-esteem.<a name="stpa_o211"></a><a name="80114-0013.htm_para7"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Joan Ryan"--><a name="08011454000018"></a>

I would also point to modern apprenticeships, which have delivered a good model of the way forward. In Enfield, however, we have a low participation rate for such apprenticeships. I believe that the introduction of diplomas for 14 to 19-year-olds, along with the Government's commitment to create 60 per cent. more apprenticeships by 2013, will further address that issue and again help to entrench vocational learning in our education system and views of learning. Young people undertaking vocational courses and employment training should not feel that they are second-class compared with those pursuing academic studies, or the poor relation. That is not good for them and it is certainly not good for our industries.<a name="stpa_o212"></a><a name="80114-0013.htm_para8"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Joan Ryan"--><a name="08011454000019"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="715"-->However, as with all matters, it is vital that the detail is practicable. After all, the Bill proposes a major change for deliverers, practitioners and businesses, not to mention the young people themselves, and we have to get it right. From my perspective as the Member for Enfield, North, most important of all are the views of those affected by these proposals in my constituency.<a name="stpa_o213"></a><a name="80114-0013.htm_para9"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Joan Ryan"--><a name="08011454000020"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="715"-->I have therefore contacted head teachers, education advisers and business representatives in my constituency, as they are experts in my area and they are on the front line of education, training and employment. I thank the practitioners from my constituency, who work tirelessly, for their contribution to developing skills in Enfield and for corresponding with me on issues in the Bill. It is crucial that we as Members of Parliament involve practitioners locally in those issues and do not just stand here and discuss them among ourselves.<a name="stpa_o214"></a><a name="80114-0013.htm_para10"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Joan Ryan"--><a name="08011454000021"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="715"-->In particular, I thank Dr. Steve Dowbiggin of Capel Manor college, and Giles Bird, head teacher at Kingsmead secondary school, which has just had the most wonderful report from Ofsted. It is breathtaking. It is a matter not of luck, but of sheer hard work. Those at the school deserve to be congratulated. I also thank Tahsin Ibrahim of the Enfield Business and Retailers Association, Jean Carter, principal of Enfield college, Bridget Evans, head teacher at Bishop Stopford's school, Sarah Knowles, Enfield's 14-to-19 strategy manager, Peter O'Brien, partnership manager at the Enfield learning and skills council and Hugh Jones from the North London chamber of commerce.<a name="stpa_o215"></a><a name="80114-0013.htm_para11"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Joan Ryan"--><a name="08011454000022"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="715"-->Overall, my constituents welcome the Bill and support its principles. Indeed, the chief executive of the Enfield Business and Retailers Association has told me that he believes that increasing the compulsory education-leaving age will provide young people with space to develop as individuals, to discover what they want from life, and to better prepare themselves for adult life.<a name="stpa_o216"></a><a name="80114-0013.htm_para12"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Joan Ryan"--><a name="08011454000023"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="715"-->Of course, this is not a Bill to force young people to stay on at school or college full-time. The proposals are flexible and are designed to meet the wide-ranging needs of young people. To date, leaving education at 16 has meant that, for some, learning has been about exams, tests and competition, but learning is of course broader and far more exciting that that. As the chief executive of Capel Manor college in my constituency states,<a name="80114-0013.htm_brev0"></a><a name="08011454000079"></a><ul><p class="tabletext">“if we are expecting young people to stay on in education and training, we need to make it relevant, exciting, worthwhile and productive, something which young people value, aspire to and can appreciate the point of.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="716"-->It is vital that we provide young people with the best possible careers, education and learning advice. That point has been raised this afternoon by a number of Members. We need to make clear the range of opportunities available after leaving school, and to ensure that young people understand how they can realise those opportunities.<a name="stpa_o219"></a><a name="80114-0013.htm_para15"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Joan Ryan"--><a name="08011454000026"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="716"-->The Bill's provisions for transferring such support services from Connexions to LEAs give rise to some questions, including in my constituency from Unison, which is concerned that LEAs might use the transfer of funds to make savings. Some local authorities would not dream of doing such a thing, but I fear that some would and that Enfield's Conservative council might be one of them. I should be grateful for reassurance from the Minister that the transfer of funds to LEAs will not mean a reduction in funding for careers advice and support.<a name="stpa_o220"></a><a name="80114-0013.htm_para16"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Joan Ryan"--><a name="08011454000027"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="716"-->An enforcement system is needed alongside the requirement to participate, but as several organisations, including some in my constituency, have pointed out, it is important that such a system does not criminalise young people. The Association of School and College Leaders suggests extending the truancy system used for schools, and the Association of Colleges acknowledges that the penalties will act as a necessary deterrent. In Enfield, the manager of our 14-to-19 education strategy expressed concern that the tracking of young people will give rise to difficulties, as is sometimes already the case in the education system pre-16. It is important to ensure that penalties are based on incentives and punishment, not just the latter, which could further disengage young people and even criminalise them.<a name="stpa_o221"></a><a name="80114-0013.htm_para17"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Joan Ryan"--><a name="08011454000028"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="716"-->There is no question but that raising the compulsory education and training leaving age to 18 will create a better-skilled work force. In the long term, employers will realise the benefits for businesses provided by the Bill and its outcomes for young people. However, it is important to acknowledge the short to medium-term impact and the possible challenges for employers, especially for small businesses. The North London chamber of commerce has outlined the challenges posed by the Bill and states that the proposals may create difficulties for smaller businesses, which might suffer capacity, logistical and financial problems from the duty on employers to release under-18s for training. The chamber of commerce also points out that such legislation would have a particular impact on the retail sector, which employs the highest number of 16 to 18-year-olds.<a name="stpa_o222"></a><a name="80114-0013.htm_para18"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Joan Ryan"--><a name="08011454000029"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="716"-->The challenges will be cushioned by the phased introduction of the legislation—2013 for 17-year-olds and 2015 for 18-year-olds—which will give employers time to adapt. I welcome the provisions to ensure that employers receive support to accredit their schemes and that there is a brokerage service to help people choose appropriate training. It is reassuring to note that models with logistical challenges can work—for example, the modern apprenticeship scheme—but it remains crucial that the Government work closely with employers and their representative organisations to ensure that implementation of the new way of working is as smooth as possible.<br><meta name="Date" content="14 Jan 2008"><notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_717"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 717</b><br><a name="stpa_o223"></a><a name="80114-0013.htm_para19"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Joan Ryan"--><a name="08011454000030"></a>

We seemed almost immediately to reach consensus in welcoming the fact that if the Bill is passed every 18-year-old will receive education and/or training. They will have the skills for employment or to go into continuing or higher education; into full-time education for those who choose it, part-time education with an element of work or voluntary work—an important aspect of the Bill—or an apprenticeship. However, we need to be careful in our definition of “apprenticeship” to ensure that it includes a proper workplace component, so that apprentices learn the real, practical skills that will make them attractive to employers.<a name="stpa_o225"></a><a name="80114-0013.htm_para21"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Angela Watkinson"--><a name="08011454000033"></a>

Debate in Committee will no doubt concentrate on those points. The Opposition are not in favour of compulsion, although we are in favour of the Bill's aims. We believe that what happens in school pre-16 is absolutely crucial in reducing truancy, disaffection, under achievement and lack of aspiration and ambition. In addition to the quality of teaching in schools, pastoral care, especially through personal, health and social education, has an important role to play in preparing students for adult life. Students should have proper information and warnings about, for example, the pitfalls of substance and drug abuse and the dangers not just for their education but for their health, motivation and progress to adult life.<a name="stpa_o226"></a><a name="80114-0013.htm_para22"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Angela Watkinson"--><a name="08011454000034"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="717"-->Time and again, when young people are interviewed, I notice that their speech is almost unintelligible. Some of that is teenage affectation and style, but often they simply do not enunciate properly, especially in our part of the world where they speak “estuary English”. They try to speak without using their tongue or any of the muscles in their mouth or jaw—without any movement at all; it is almost as though they are ventriloquists. I hope that PHSE can help young people to understand that if they want to find a job, or even be enrolled on an apprenticeship scheme, they need to be able to communicate with non-teenagers who do not speak their language. Being understood is an important part of communicating with adults.<br><meta name="Date" content="14 Jan 2008"><notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_718"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 718</b><br><a name="st_o287"></a><a name="08011454000035"></a>

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="718"-->Several organisations are picking up on the importance of fiscal education, which my hon. Friend mentioned earlier. When young people go into the adult world, especially when they start to earn, it is essential that they understand that the amount at the top of their payslip, which is what they have earned, is not the same as the amount at the bottom, which is what they actually receive. If nothing else, they need to learn the Micawber principle: if they live on slightly less than the amount they have earned they will stay out of debt.<a name="stpa_o228"></a><a name="80114-0013.htm_para24"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Angela Watkinson"--><a name="08011454000038"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="718"-->We all know how big an issue personal debt is at present. The year before last, personal debt in the UK reached the £1 trillion mark. Given the habit of borrowing on multiple credit cards and transferring debt from one to another, people need to be educated about the long-term effects of not living within their means.<a name="stpa_o229"></a><a name="80114-0013.htm_para25"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Angela Watkinson"--><a name="08011454000039"></a>

Every year in Havering, a young people's awards ceremony is organised by local police, and I am always surprised at how many very young children who care for their parents feature each year. Their parents have disabilities or are ill. Such children often have to go home in the lunch hour to make sure that their parent is all right. They do shopping on the way home, keep house and do laundry and all the nuts-and-bolts household tasks. They bear tremendous responsibilities on their shoulders and need as much extra support as they can get, at school and elsewhere, to help them to achieve their educational potential so that their opportunities in adult life are not blighted by their caring responsibilities as children.<a name="stpa_o230"></a><a name="80114-0013.htm_para26"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Angela Watkinson"--><a name="08011454000040"></a>

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="719"-->Barnardo's also mentions early parenthood, which has been raised several times in the debate and links in with PSHE. Girls need proper warnings about the dangers to which they expose themselves if they engage in promiscuous sexual activity. They can end up literally holding the baby and having responsibility for a young child when they are still children themselves. Some are lucky enough still to be living at home and have the support and protection of their parents, who may take responsibility for the baby so that their daughter can go back to school and continue her education. However, not all such girls find themselves in those circumstances. We need to find ways of supporting the young girls who do not have the support of home and family, so that they are not left isolated in a council flat with 24-hour-a-day responsibility for a demanding baby when they are still children themselves. We need to consider ways in which the baby can be cared for while the girl continues her education and training so that she has long-term prospects of joining adult life. Barnardo's comments:<a name="80114-0013.htm_brev6"></a><a name="08011454000085"></a><ul><p class="tabletext">“Many of the NEET population effectively cease to participate long before they reach 16—through exclusion, persistent truancy or simply not engaging when they are in school.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="719"-->I turn now to children with special educational needs, who are most difficult to place in continuing education or employment. This year, 2008, is the year of reading and I hope that in Committee there will be an opportunity to improve opportunities for partially sighted students. The parents of such students have contacted me because it is not possible to get school textbooks on disc. In this day and age, I would have thought that a fairly simple thing to achieve. Partially sighted children need very large, bold font and are unable to access their textbooks until their teacher has photocopied and enlarged the relevant pages for the lesson. That is a waste of the teacher's and students' time—the students cannot get on with their lessons and, particularly, their homework. Making school textbooks available on disc so that they can be accessed by computer and partially sighted students can get on seems a fairly simple solution. If 2008 is the year of reading, let us grasp that issue and try to help partially sighted students in that way.<a name="stpa_o239"></a><a name="80114-0014.htm_para0"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Angela Watkinson"--><a name="08011454000050"></a>

Member for Upminster (Angela Watkinson), who always speaks with good sense, based on good experience, on these matters. I want to associate myself with those who have said that this is an historic opportunity. The Government are legislating to change the education leaving age to 18, with clear benefits, both social and economic, for individuals and for the country. That is an important aspect of the Bill, but not by any means the whole of it. As the Leitch review highlighted, the need for skilled people is growing, and the Bill's provisions, which also focus on improving opportunities for young people and adults alike, will help to meet the needs of a high skill economy.<a name="stpa_o244"></a><a name="80114-0014.htm_para5"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Gordon Marsden"--><a name="08011454000060"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="721"-->I should like to address three themes from the Bill: how we include the excluded; how we bridge the gap between the value that we place on vocational study and on academic study; and, perhaps most interestingly, how we create new architecture to promote dialogue and a greater sense of responsibility on the part of the private and public sectors of our schools and begin to bridge the historical gap between them.<a name="stpa_o245"></a><a name="80114-0014.htm_para6"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Gordon Marsden"--><a name="08011454000061"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="721"-->As chair of the all-party group on skills and a member of two successive Education Committees, I have witnessed the development of Government policy on education and skills. It has been a long and significant journey over the past 10 years. Highlights included the Tomlinson review, which brought about the revolution in vocational learning that we are now extending. That revolution has progressed particularly under this new Government under two new Secretaries of State and a Prime Minister whose commitment to skills while in Government, for 10 years as Chancellor of the Exchequer and now as Prime Minister, has been unrelenting. The Bill enshrines in legislation much of what Governments have been working towards for some time. It sends a strong and positive message to young people as well as to adults and promotes excellence and educational progression in a supported and well-resourced environment.<a name="stpa_o246"></a><a name="80114-0014.htm_para7"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Gordon Marsden"--><a name="08011454000062"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="721"-->Raising the age at which teenagers remain in education to 18 should not be about dragooning them to stay on in education regardless, or straitjacketing them, but it should embody a recognition that it is not a realistic, life-changing option to enter the world of work without skills of some kind or another. That is why the Bill's central commitment to 18 is book-ended by provisions that value vocational skills and promote social inclusion. I hope that it will prompt us to look at new structures in pre-16 and post-16 education—for example, the studio schools that are being suggested in my local authority in the context of the Building Schools for the Future project. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) said, we must crack the problem of bright young people who feel isolated from the education process. There must be much more on-site learning, and we must raise those people's aspirations. A few years ago, I went on a visit with the Education Committee to North Carolina, where we saw how children as young as 13 or 14 who were traditionally isolated and alienated from academic learning did powerfully well in skills academies within schools. We should consider that option in future.<br><meta name="Date" content="14 Jan 2008"><notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_722"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 722</b><br><a name="stpa_o247"></a><a name="80114-0014.htm_para8"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Gordon Marsden"--><a name="08011454000063"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="722"-->The Bill transfers responsibility for the Connexions service to local authorities. I hope that that will give us an opportunity to develop a step change in information, advice and guidance provision, and that the local link interacting between local authorities and mainstream educational services and children's trusts will enable Connexions to provide a better service that responds more flexibly to the local economy, career opportunities and the skills base.<a name="st_o294"></a><a name="08011454000064"></a>

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="722"-->Historically, Blackpool has not had a good record in terms of skills and people staying on in education beyond 16. Because of the nature of the local economy, with the emphasis on leisure, tourism and the related strength of small and medium-sized enterprises, vocational courses are very important. They range from traditional tourism and leisure courses, which are delivered to an excellent standard by my local further education college, Blackpool and the Fylde, to innovative ones. I do not want to tempt providence, but Blackpool and the Fylde college, along with other colleges, now offers courses as a member of the national Gaming Academy, whereby trainees have been able to hone their skills in mock casinos—in future, I hope, in real ones.<a name="stpa_o249"></a><a name="80114-0014.htm_para10"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Marsden"--><a name="08011454000067"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="722"-->Connexions services should now be more likely to collaborate with local employers and businesses, but the Bill puts a key responsibility on local authorities to develop those links. While localising services, national standards must be maintained. Defining how local authorities use the financial resources that they will be given will be crucial to their success. Even at the time of the Learning and Skills Act 2000, which set up the Connexions service and on whose Standing Committee I served, concerns were raised about inherent weaknesses in a system that was not mainstream enough and was focused semi-exclusively on NEETs—those not in education, employment or training. I hope that we will be able to move on from that under the new arrangements. In Blackpool, the Connexions service has had a striking impact on providing services for NEETs—I pay tribute to Mike Taplin and his colleagues—but there are other groups to consider. In the course of the Bill's passage, Ministers should explore mechanisms to ensure that local authorities ring-fence the money that is given to them for information, advice and guidance, because it is crucial that those authorities use those resources effectively. That was among the issues that the Skills Commission touched on in its interim report.<a name="stpa_o250"></a><a name="80114-0014.htm_para11"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Marsden"--><a name="08011454000068"></a>

Completion rates have significantly improved—in Blackpool, by some 50 per cent. in a recent 12-month period. However, we need carefully to consider the structure of apprenticeships, particularly for those who are reskilling. The target of 500,000 apprenticeships by 2010 is ambitious and we should be proud of it, but in that process it is important that adult apprenticeships are not ignored. That is why I welcome the explicit duty in the Bill to ensure that the Learning and Skills Council makes reasonable provision in that regard; it should make that a major feature of its work. This is an opportunity for the LSC to deliver a strategic target rather than just to micro-manage part of the process.<a name="stpa_o251"></a><a name="80114-0014.htm_para12"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Marsden"--><a name="08011454000069"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="723"-->Reskilling older workers is a growing challenge. In some cases, a greater combination of in-work activity and a modular approach will increase completion rates. Apprenticeships must be flexible and modular, particularly in the context of small and medium-sized businesses, of which we have many in Blackpool. It is particularly important that adult apprenticeships work for women who are reskilling and who may need time out for caring and other duties. That is one of the reasons why I welcome the £90 million announced by the Secretary of State recently to encourage small and medium-sized businesses to take up apprenticeships and expand training.<a name="stpa_o252"></a><a name="80114-0014.htm_para13"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Marsden"--><a name="08011454000070"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="723"-->Social mobility and social inclusion are key elements of the Bill because improving the prospects of, and career options for, young people has consequences for their health and well-being as well as for their financial stability. Other hon. Members have already referred to part 2, which has a strong focus on the needs of children with learning difficulties. One of the most at- risk groups, members of which often leave education at 16, is that of disabled children and those with special educational needs. The issue of carry-over between the pre and post-16 stage for special educational needs is also highly important. The Select Committee on Education and Skills, which I served on, produced a report on SEN in July 2006 that made particular reference to that issue, and to the fact that it has not been dealt with well in the past. The work that children's and adults' services do is vital to the improvement of information exchange, continuity, support and advice for young people with SEN.<a name="stpa_o253"></a><a name="80114-0014.htm_para14"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Marsden"--><a name="08011454000071"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="723"-->In that context, it is right to praise the work done for children, schools and families by the Secretary of State—in his previous capacity—and his noble Friend Lord Adonis. The most recent fruit of their activity was the report “Aiming high for disabled children”, which contained a funding package of £340 million, including a transition fund for young disabled people moving into adulthood. The Government need to consider whether there should be further advocacy and support for disabled young people.<a name="stpa_o254"></a><a name="80114-0014.htm_para15"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Marsden"--><a name="08011454000072"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="723"-->The provisions in the Bill for 19 to 25-year-olds are welcome, but it will be useful to explore in Committee how we might increase that threshold. Although the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises have been addressed by the £90 million that the Secretary of State promised, we perhaps also need to look at how things will work in practice.<br><meta name="Date" content="14 Jan 2008"><notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_724"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 724</b><br><a name="stpa_o255"></a><a name="80114-0014.htm_para16"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Marsden"--><a name="08011454000073"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="724"-->Finally, I turn to the issue of co-operation between the private and public sectors. The Bill, by rationalising the regulation and monitoring of independent schools, makes large strides towards increased co-operation between the independent and public school sectors. Appointing Ofsted as a regulator of independent schools will streamline the process, which shows the Government's resolve to share understanding and knowledge between the public and independent spheres of education. The proposals come at a time when we have an historic opportunity to bridge the divide that has stultified educational progress in our country during the past 30 years. I believe that the Government, in their funding, intentions and structures, are committed to bridging that divide. However, it is key that we do so at a time when social mobility is a real issue, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) made clear in his recent excellent pamphlet on social mobility.<a name="stpa_o256"></a><a name="80114-0014.htm_para17"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Marsden"--><a name="08011454000074"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="724"-->The private sector must reach out to the communities it is embedded in. It must use its facilities to facilitate that contact and reach out with its techniques. But the public sector, too, must accept that it can learn things from the private sector. I would like to refer to two recent reports that illustrate some of the problems. The Sutton Trust produced a report that shows that a significant percentage of state school teachers would still not encourage their brightest pupils to apply to Oxbridge or other leading universities. Sir Peter Lampl, the chair of the Sutton Trust, said:<a name="80114-0014.htm_brev1"></a><a name="08011454000087"></a><ul><p class="tabletext">“It is clear that much more needs to be done to dispel the myths about Oxbridge and other leading universities, and to ensure that young people's higher education decisions are based on fact not fiction.”</ul><a name="stpa_o257"></a><a name="80114-0014.htm_para18"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Marsden"--><a name="08011454000075"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="724"-->Equally, the Charity Commission is about to publish guidance on what private schools must do to satisfy new laws requiring them to prove their public benefit. In today's edition of<i> The</i><i> Times</i> there is a depressing litany of complacency and smugness on the part of the bursars of some of the leading private schools, who seem to be unaware of the need to build such a bridge.<a name="stpa_o258"></a><a name="80114-0014.htm_para19"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Marsden"--><a name="08011454000076"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="724"-->We should build that bridge, not least because the general public want us to do so. A recent survey of public attitudes on the issue showed that half the respondents said that greater collaboration between private and maintained schools would improve state education. Nearly a fifth said that opening up those school facilities to the community was the key. I want to see such co-operation extended, and I believe that that will be to the benefit of all students in schools.<a name="stpa_o259"></a><a name="80114-0014.htm_para20"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Marsden"--><a name="08011454000077"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="724"-->In conclusion, the narrative that the Government are taking forward for the 21st century through the Bill is that we are not here to fight the battles of the past. Although I welcome some of the things said by the Opposition, it is genuinely disappointing that some Opposition Members have been too slow to recognise that vocational qualifications are not an alternative to excellence, but part of it. In the fast moving 21st century, lifelong learning must combine skills and traditional methods of learning as seamlessly as possible—vocational and academic together. By 2020, we cannot afford to turn anyone down because they are stuck in one compartment.<a name="stpa_o260"></a><a name="80114-0014.htm_para21"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Marsden"--><a name="08011454000078"></a>

There are far too many young people in the NEET group—not in education, employment or training—and there are far too many pre-16 students truanting from mainstream education. A figure of 10 per cent. was suggested earlier. In comparison with just 20 years ago, jobs for unskilled, unqualified people of any age, let alone 16 to 19-year-olds or those in their 20s, barely exist. When Margaret Thatcher was presiding over the destruction of the British manufacturing industry, it was suggested, not least by her, that while basic mass manufacturing could be done in the developing world, which had cheaper wages and so on and could therefore compete far more effectively at that level, countries such as Britain, and elsewhere in Europe, could survive through internal service industries and high-skills industries that would sell to the rest of the world.<a name="stpa_o261"></a><a name="80114-0014.htm_para22"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Paul Holmes"--><a name="08011467000002"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="725"-->However, we cannot be complacent about those jobs either. Last year, the Select Committee on Education and Skills, as it then was, visited China; we went to Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing. We saw the phenomenal change and growth in that country—the massive expansion of university provision and the educational changes going through. As part of our investigation, we read about what was happening in countries such as India, which is competing with the west at every level, from universities to massive graphic design companies to massive call centres. No one in Britain or other western European countries can today assume that the sort of jobs that people could once get with no qualifications or low qualifications exist any more. They certainly will not exist in a few years' time. The intent of the Bill is welcome, therefore.<a name="stpa_o262"></a><a name="80114-0014.htm_para23"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Paul Holmes"--><a name="08011467000003"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="725"-->I speak as someone who spent 22 years working in education and six years on the Education and Skills Committee looking at education throughout this country and in many others. While I was a teacher, I spent three to four years as an assistant head of year 10 and year 11, and 12 years as a head of sixth form. During those 16 years, I spent an awful lot of time every year working to persuade pupils to stay on in post-16 education. I tried to encourage them to take A-levels and to go on to university, or to stay on and take a qualification known as the certificate of pre-vocational education, which was designed for those who had not achieved their five A to Cs and who wanted to up their basic skills. There was a year-long course in which they sampled different vocational outlets to see whether that would give them an idea of where they wanted to go once they had upped themselves to a level 2 qualification.<a name="stpa_o263"></a><a name="80114-0014.htm_para24"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Paul Holmes"--><a name="08011467000004"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="725"-->That course was scrapped and replaced by GNVQs. My school had one of the first sixth forms to introduce that in the whole country; it was one of the first 30<br><meta name="Date" content="14 Jan 2008"><notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_726"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 726</b><br>institutions, most of which were colleges, to introduce the courses. I worked hard to persuade pupils of a range of abilities—from intermediate GNVQ to advanced—to stay on. I also worked to encourage pupils to stay on and take part in a college-school partnership that existed for a number of years between one of the schools at which I worked—I was the head of the sixth form there—and the local further education college, so I have a long and wide experience of working with the client group referred to in the Bill about whom we are in part talking today.<a name="stpa_o264"></a><a name="80114-0014.htm_para25"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Paul Holmes"--><a name="08011467000005"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="726"-->I support a huge amount of the intention behind the Bill, but like so many others I query the compulsion element, as have a vast range of organisations of every kind, including the Institute of Directors, various teachers unions, the TUC, the British Youth Council, Barnardo's, the Local Government Association, and the National Bureau for Students with Disabilities, as well as the children's commissioner—the list just goes on and on. The Government should consider the weight of that evidence and what has been said today, and think again about the compulsion element.<a name="stpa_o265"></a><a name="80114-0014.htm_para26"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Paul Holmes"--><a name="08011467000006"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="726"-->The Government need to consider carefully why the problem that they are trying to deal with through compulsion exists. In part, the problem is to do with the situation in post-16 education traditionally, in particular the poor funding for post-16 students in further education compared with that for students in school-based sixth forms, and the poor funding for FE from 19 onwards compared with that for people in higher education, as well as the lack of flexibility in FE provision. For example, a huge problem is that people either complete an apprenticeship or they get nothing out of it—they cannot build up work in a credits-based system.<a name="stpa_o266"></a><a name="80114-0014.htm_para27"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Paul Holmes"--><a name="08011467000007"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="726"-->The situation is very much the same with college courses. Lots of college principals and teachers with whom I have talked over the years bemoan the fact that we do not have a system such as that which some years ago the Education and Skills Committee saw working incredibly well in California, the fifth largest economy in the world in its own right. Some 60 per cent. of the population in the relevant age group in California have university degrees, but the average age at which people complete them is 35, because a lot of students build up part-time accreditation over 15 to 18 years. Those students take a course, take a year off to work or take part-time courses, building up credits over a long period of time. We do not have that in this country, which affects the whole of FE and has an effect on those in the age group who might want to work and might also want to improve their skills, but who cannot take the mix-and-match approach that works so well in other countries.<a name="stpa_o267"></a><a name="80114-0014.htm_para28"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Paul Holmes"--><a name="08011467000008"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="726"-->We also have a lack of apprenticeship places, which the Government have been attempting to redress, albeit certainly not on the scale that the Education and Skills Committee saw some years ago in Denmark, where there is an incredibly wide network of apprenticeship places. Denmark also has an employers' levy, which all employers pay. All the employers there chip into the apprenticeship system, and since they have already paid the money they might as well get a free apprentice out of it, instead of regarding taking on an apprentice as a problem, which is how many employers in Britain unfortunately regard it.<a name="stpa_o268"></a><a name="80114-0015.htm_para0"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Paul Holmes"--><a name="08011467000009"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="727"-->There are a lot of problems in the post-16 system that need addressing. The major problem is not with the system itself but with what happens pre-16, as a number of Members have already mentioned. For example, in his response to the Green Paper that led to the Bill, Dr. John Dunford from the Association of School and College Leaders said:<a name="80114-0015.htm_brev0"></a><a name="08011467000137"></a><ul><p class="tabletext">“The young people impacted by this bill primarily will be those who have turned their back on education and training.”</ul><a name="stpa_o269"></a><a name="80114-0015.htm_para1"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Paul Holmes"--><a name="08011467000010"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="727"-->He said that we have to re-engage those young people, which will be a “huge challenge”. Will compulsion really be the way to achieve that, when most of that group have already switched off, dropped out or even truanted before 16, let alone after? In his response to the Green Paper that led to the Bill, the children's commissioner said:<a name="80114-0015.htm_brev1"></a><a name="08011467000138"></a><ul><p class="tabletext">“Our support for a raised participation age is conditional on changes to the educational culture within schools. Meaningful participation must begin long before 18, and long before Key Stage 4. We look for greater evidence of progress towards giving students a more significant voice in their own education and the running of their own schools.”</ul><a name="stpa_o270"></a><a name="80114-0015.htm_para2"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Paul Holmes"--><a name="08011467000011"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="727"-->The problem arises before the NEET group appears, not just at age 16.<a name="stpa_o271"></a><a name="80114-0015.htm_para3"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Paul Holmes"--><a name="08011467000012"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="727"-->Why do so many fail to engage pre-16? A lot of what I say will be coloured by my experience working in schools for 22 years, the experience of my three children, who have been through the state system, and my experience of serving on the Education and Skills Committee for six years, looking at different education systems across the country and throughout the world. One of the problems is that we have had three landmark changes in education, all of which have worked against the interests of the sort of education that we want to see in schools. The shift that took place between the '50s and the '70s was from selective schools to comprehensives, in so far as we have ever had such schools—we have never had a system of well-funded and respected local community schools or comprehensives in this country, as can be seen Finland, which tops the programme for international student assessment studies, or PISA studies, for success.<a name="stpa_o272"></a><a name="80114-0015.htm_para4"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Paul Holmes"--><a name="08011467000013"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="727"-->Then there was the O-level system, which was designed to be attempted by only 40 per cent. of the population and failed by a chunk of them, with perhaps only 30 per cent. passing, after which the certificate of secondary education was added, to cover the other 60 per cent. Finally, the two were merged in the GCSE, the introduction of which I was involved in, as a head of department back in the 1980s. Then there was the raising of the school leaving age, or ROSLA, the last occasion being in 1972-73. My year group at school was the last that could leave at 15 with no qualifications whatever and go into unskilled work, as some of my friends did.<a name="stpa_o273"></a><a name="80114-0015.htm_para5"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Paul Holmes"--><a name="08011467000014"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="727"-->One of the problems with all those landmarks was that we tried to impose an academic, grammar school-style curriculum on everyone. Being a mini grammar school was seen as the only thing worth doing, because academia was all that counted in this country. That was worsened by the massive, over-detailed, over-prescriptive and over-academic national curriculum, and further worsened by the intense atmosphere of frequent high-stakes testing, league tables and the professional pay review process, all of which I experienced in my professional career before being elected to this place. Let us remind ourselves<br><meta name="Date" content="14 Jan 2008"><notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_728"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 728</b><br>that, as has been said, truancy has increased in the past 10 years, as the Government introduced those measures. Perhaps we should look at what effect those measures had on increasing the rate of truancy.<a name="stpa_o274"></a><a name="80114-0015.htm_para6"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Paul Holmes"--><a name="08011467000015"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="728"-->The two big PISA studies show that our rate of success in literacy and numeracy has fallen, from one study to the next, as the children who went through the literacy and numeracy strategy in junior schools came through to the secondary level and into the PISA age range. I taught children who were already turned off the school process at the age of 11—between 1979 and 1997, under the previous Government, as well as between 1997 and 2001, under this Government. By the age of 14, that situation was much worse; by 16 it was a nightmare. Some of those children had been a problem in school at the age of 14, 15 or 16, but when I went to visit them on work experience in the summer of year 10, I met entirely different people, working in an adult environment and doing something that they were enthused by. We have to harness those two sides of school to the benefit of everyone, in order to pre-empt the creation of the NEET group.<a name="stpa_o275"></a><a name="80114-0015.htm_para7"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Paul Holmes"--><a name="08011467000016"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="728"-->We must allow schools pre-16 the funding, the class sizes and the curriculum flexibility to engage all our children, not just the academic. We must not turn off such a significant proportion of our children. However, we are told that innovation and freedom from the national curriculum can be exercised only by schools that are outside the state system—the tiny minority of academies, for example, or the trust schools in their original version, before the watered-down version introduced after a Government Back-Bench rebellion altered the previous education Bill. Schools have to be outside the system.<a name="stpa_o276"></a><a name="80114-0015.htm_para8"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Paul Holmes"--><a name="08011467000017"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="728"-->What folly is it that says that we need innovation in our schools, but that we cannot trust education professionals to deliver it? We are told that the vast majority must be regulated to within an inch of their lives in order to teach in our schools—and yet if a school is taken over or set up by an outside body such as a religious body, or by millionaire used-car salesmen, fashion designers, carpet kings, creationists or wealthy City slickers, all of a sudden the school can have curriculum innovation. I just do not understand the logic of that, and have said so repeatedly in the Chamber in the past six years.<a name="stpa_o277"></a><a name="80114-0015.htm_para9"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Paul Holmes"--><a name="08011467000018"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="728"-->The current situation is nonsense; it is the education policy of the madhouse. I have worked under five heads, four of whom—not who the first one he was a traditionalist ex-senior Army officer—wanted to innovate, but were increasingly frustrated as the years passed by the diktats from the Minister in Whitehall. We should allow that freedom to all our schools, not just the chosen few set up by random outside bodies or wealthy individuals.<a name="stpa_o278"></a><a name="80114-0015.htm_para10"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Paul Holmes"--><a name="08011467000019"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="728"-->I hope and trust that those in my party who are now talking about free schools, possibly in the same vein, will not go down the route that the Government and the Conservative party have followed. I am reassured in part by the conversation that I had with my Front-Bench colleague, my hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws), and will watch the policy developments carefully over the next year.<a name="stpa_o279"></a><a name="80114-0015.htm_para11"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Paul Holmes"--><a name="08011467000020"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="728"-->Finally, it seems that the same situation applies to post-16, too.

It is almost as if the only way that those who work in FE post-16 can deliver a good education to their charges is to force an unwilling client group, which will then scare those FE tutors into doing their job properly.<a name="stpa_o280"></a><a name="80114-0015.htm_para12"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Paul Holmes"--><a name="08011467000021"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="729"-->I have visited lots of colleges, including Chesterfield college, North Nottinghamshire college, Chester college and colleges across London—I also visited many when I was a teacher—and I have never met an FE principal who did not want to innovate and experiment. They would tell me, however, that the major obstacles that they faced were Government policy, Government funding processes and the dead hand of central Government. We must free up our schools and colleges and not try to impose ever more intensive and detailed central Government control. We must trust the education professionals, not the random amateurs from outside who set up schools.<a name="ordayhd_15"></a><a name="80114-0015.htm_ordayhd0"></a><a name="08011467000143"></a><h5 align="left">8 pm</h5><a name="st_o297"></a><a name="08011467000022"></a>

Newly qualified, I started teaching in the early 1970s at what was then the Crown Hills secondary modern school in Leicester. I quickly learned my place in the school hierarchy when I was given the ROSLA class, which contained those who were there as a result of the raising of the school leaving age. More experienced colleagues were given the opportunity to teach the CSE group, and the heads of department got the small number of students who were doing O-levels. I am not sure whether it was a case of me being dumped on the ROSLA class or it being dumped on me, but it was certainly a rough first year of teaching. I am convinced that I learned more in that year than the students ever did.<a name="stpa_o281"></a><a name="80114-0015.htm_para13"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Sir Peter Soulsby"--><a name="08011467000023"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="729"-->The reality was that a high proportion of those who were obliged to stay on for that extra year did not want to be there and resented the fact that they had to be. The situation was complicated by the fact that those who could leave at Easter did so, and those who could not left in the summer term as soon as they could get away with doing so. Indeed, there was often much relief for me and my colleagues when the most disaffected students decided that it was not worth turning up after Christmas.<a name="stpa_o282"></a><a name="80114-0015.htm_para14"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Sir Peter Soulsby"--><a name="08011467000024"></a>

It is now fully comprehensive and a very successful sports college. It is enormously grateful to the Government for what they have done to enable it to meet its full potential as a college, allowing it to meet the needs of the diverse range of students from different backgrounds who attend it.

The Government have recognised that such an experience, although perhaps worth while in the longer term, was traumatic for those who were a part of it. They are right to stress that we need to offer a right not only to education beyond the age of 16 but to training, and a right for that education or training to be relevant to those who take part in it and, we hope, benefit from it.<a name="stpa_o284"></a><a name="80114-0015.htm_para16"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Sir Peter Soulsby"--><a name="08011467000026"></a>

Whether it is necessary or not, we all hope that that power will not have to be relied on a great deal by those involved in making a success of the extension of education and training to the age of 18. None the less, I am convinced that it will be necessary. Although there were many failings in the way in which the raising of the school leaving age was introduced in the early 1970s, it would not have been possible to achieve it without the element of compulsion that underlay it.<a name="stpa_o285"></a><a name="80114-0015.htm_para17"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Sir Peter Soulsby"--><a name="08011467000027"></a>

A lot of groundwork has already been done to enable the realisation of the Government's vision of doing something other than just sitting 16 to 18-year-olds in a classroom for an extra couple of years and forcing them to suffer what many of them have already become disaffected with, even before reaching that age.<a name="stpa_o287"></a><a name="80114-0015.htm_para19"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Sir Peter Soulsby"--><a name="08011467000031"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="731"-->I want briefly to mention two examples of very good practice in my constituency. The first is Leicester college, in the higher education sector. It is one of the largest further education colleges in the United Kingdom, and it deals with total student numbers of 27,000-plus. It is a good example of the ability of the education sector generally to deal with the diverse needs of its students and with the needs of the community that it serves. It has won many awards, and tailors its courses to include subjects that are relevant to the students and to the local community, including print skills, retail, construction and enterprise. Increasingly, information technology and computing are among its successes. It is also doing an increasing amount with one of the local universities, De Montfort university, and providing a good example of taking forward existing opportunities to meet the challenges that will undoubtedly come from increasing the age of participation in education and training from 16 to 18.<a name="stpa_o288"></a><a name="80114-0015.htm_para20"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Sir Peter Soulsby"--><a name="08011467000032"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="731"-->I also want to mention Regent college in my constituency. It was set up as a sixth-form college on the premises of a former grammar school. It had a heavy academic bias at its inception, but it has now adapted to the needs of its community in a way that is really quite remarkable, under the impressive leadership of its principal, Eddie Playfair. The college now deals with a very diverse intake of students, including increasing numbers from the newly arrived Somali community in the city, and it is able to offer a varied curriculum—from A-levels and GCSEs to a whole range of vocational courses. It can also support students who would traditionally have looked only to the FE college for courses that interested them.<a name="stpa_o289"></a><a name="80114-0015.htm_para21"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Sir Peter Soulsby"--><a name="08011467000033"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="731"-->Regent college thrives because its students want to be there, which is the whole point of the proposals in the Bill. As I argued earlier, compulsion needs to be one element, but success will be judged overwhelmingly by whether students want to be in education. It is the case that many education institutions in my constituency and throughout the UK are already thinking outside the box and are already recognising that they need to offer courses that are relevant to the local economy, but relevant above all to their students, so that they will continue to want to be there.<a name="stpa_o290"></a><a name="80114-0015.htm_para22"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Sir Peter Soulsby"--><a name="08011467000034"></a>

My response was that it was for their own good. I tried to explain in a little more detail than that, but that was the essence of it. It is also the answer given to young people in education generally—that they are there for their own good. I believe that the Government are right that we are entitled to say to 16 to 18-year-olds that it is for their own good that they remain in education or training, or in the very flexible range of alternatives offered in the Bill. We are also entitled to say that it is for society's good and for the good of the economy, but the Bill's extension of provision is most fundamentally of all for the good of those participating in 16 to 18 education and training. The Government and the whole education service face the challenge of demonstrating to young people that it is indeed for their own good and ensuring that, when we say that to them, it is really true.<a name="stpa_o292"></a><a name="80114-0015.htm_para24"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Sir Peter Soulsby"--><a name="08011467000036"></a>

In view of the many economic changes and competitive pressures from the far east, it could be that improved education and skills are not just a good thing but a prerequisite for our country. On a recent Select Committee visit to China, I was struck by the appetite of the students I met there for education. In deciding what course to take or what university to attend, not only the student but the entire family—often several generations—participated in the decision. In the light of the challenge from China and other countries, we do not face competition simply in the manufacturing industry sector; we also face it in the sphere of intellectual value-added capital.<a name="stpa_o294"></a><a name="80114-0015.htm_para26"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Douglas Carswell"--><a name="08011467000039"></a>

The Government have not only made many laws on education, but spent a great deal of money on it, which no one can really dispute. In the Clacton area of my constituency, for example, they have spent £14 million on a brand new school, Bishop's Park college. The problem is not spending that money on education, which is excellent, but the fact that after just two years, they are trying to close the school down. It was opened formally by the previous Prime Minister two and a half years ago, yet it now faces closure.<a name="st_o303"></a><a name="08011467000044"></a>

All the evidence suggests to me that they cannot, and that is also the case with raising standards in education and schools. I venture to suggest that any improvements will take place despite, not because of, the Bill. People will gain skills and education because they want to do so, and choose to do so, not because Government decree it. It would be good if more young people remained in education and training.

As a member of what was the Education and Skills Committee, I have been deeply uninspired by some of the officials who have appeared before the Committee from time to time. Using officialdom to determine what skills are taught is a form of central planning. Economic change makes it likely that the country will need new skills, yet it is almost impossible to know accurately what those skills will be. Twenty years ago, who could have known what software design skills were needed? Five years ago, who could be certain what know-how was required? Economic change requires innovative skills. I very much doubt that officials at the LEAs or the QCA are best placed to know what innovations are around the corner.

Rather than saying, “Let's just focus on schools,” we need to do two things—we cannot just leave to one side and forget those people who missed out in school and therefore finished up at 16 with insufficient numeracy, literacy and other skills.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="736"-->Another point about local authorities is that they had a large role in providing apprenticeships in the past—a role that ought to be massively expanded now. In the construction sector in particular, local authorities took on apprentices in direct works organisations and provided a source of skilled workers for the private construction sector. It was understood that getting people into industry with skills, through apprenticeships, was part of government-subsidised training. I hope that direct labour organisations will be given their head, and that local authorities will again soon be given a much bigger role in doing their own construction work, and therefore have a basis for providing many more apprenticeships in that sector in particular.<a name="stpa_o306"></a><a name="80114-0016.htm_para9"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Kelvin Hopkins"--><a name="08011467000060"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="736"-->Another issue is the variety of education provision on offer. Anybody looking at Britain from the outside must think that we have had some kind of mad Maoist revolution, with a thousand flowers blooming, because almost no local authority's pattern of provision is similar to that of the next-door local authority. There must be 20, 30 or 40 different patterns in every local authority. If we were to compare how they function, we might find that one was better than the others, and we ought perhaps to adopt it. I do not suggest another wholesale revolution to impose a system of education, but I do think that some systems of education, or patterns of provision, are better than others and would help with the problem that we now face. I would say this, would I not, but I think that Luton has the right system. We have a system of 11-to-16 high schools, and the best further education college in the country. I say that advisedly: it was the first FE college to be given beacon status, and has repeatedly been given a grade 1 in inspections. We also have one of the best sixth-form colleges in the country, if not the best. It too has beacon status, and has repeatedly been given a grade 1. As I happen to be vice-chair of the governors of that college I might be expected to boast about it, but I bask in reflected glory. The fact that the college is so good is not to do with my input; it is to do with the wonderful staff and management, and indeed the fine students.<a name="stpa_o307"></a><a name="80114-0016.htm_para10"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Kelvin Hopkins"--><a name="08011467000061"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="736"-->That kind of provision seems to me ideal in the context of the problem that we currently face—alienated 16-year-olds who do not want to stay at school, especially if they are in a sixth form in which all the high-fliers are doing their A-levels and going to university, and they themselves are not doing very well. If they have the opportunity of going to a very good further education college which is large and has an enormous variety of provision, they will be more inclined to consider education or training after the age of 16.<a name="stpa_o308"></a><a name="80114-0016.htm_para11"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Kelvin Hopkins"--><a name="08011467000062"></a>

Those problems have now been addressed by good head teachers who were brought in to solve them. Schools in my constituency that were in special measures have now come out of them. We have a collaborative approach, Campus Luton, which covers schools and colleges. One thing that I have discovered from my experience of our sixth-form college is that such colleges learn from other sixth-form colleges. There is cross-pollination, which I think would also be a good thing in schools.<a name="stpa_o310"></a><a name="80114-0016.htm_para13"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Kelvin Hopkins"--><a name="08011467000064"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="737"-->The problems in schools have been mentioned many times today. They are serious, and they have not yet been rectified. I am now going to be controversial. I think that many of those problems derive from a deeply misguided revolution in teaching methods which started some 40 years ago. I believe that informal methods—kindly described as child-centred education—were a profound mistake. Generations of young people have missed the chance of being taught mathematics and English properly. Now we are struggling gradually towards where we should have been all those years ago, and starting to reconsider phonics and a more rigorous approach to the teaching of mathematics to ensure that people have those skills when they are very young. For children who miss out on mathematics in particular—although the same can perhaps be said of literacy—starting at the age of 10 is much more difficult than learning at seven. The longer it is left, the harder it is.<a name="stpa_o311"></a><a name="80114-0016.htm_para14"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Kelvin Hopkins"--><a name="08011467000065"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="737"-->I remember that 25 years ago, at the height of the mad “informal methods” revolution, the head teacher at William Tyndale school in London—I do not know whether anyone remembers that famous school—said, “If half the children in my school can read when they leave at the age of 11, I shall be very pleased.” He thought that that was success; I think that it was appalling. Fortunately the head teacher was sacked, but it was a turning point. People thought that the revolution had gone so far that it had become completely insane.<a name="stpa_o312"></a><a name="80114-0016.htm_para15"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Kelvin Hopkins"--><a name="08011467000066"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="737"-->The problem was that tens of thousands of teachers had been told that that was the way in which to teach, and it was hard for them to be told in mid-career, “I am sorry, but the methods that we told you about when you were at teacher training college are actually rather mistaken, and we ought to start returning to some of the more rigorous approaches to the teaching of mathematics, reading and writing”—methods that I experienced in the 1940s and 1950s. Many teachers did not like being told that, and were very defensive.<a name="stpa_o313"></a><a name="80114-0016.htm_para16"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Kelvin Hopkins"--><a name="08011467000067"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="737"-->Several of my relatives were teachers. At dinner I would occasionally mention the suggestion that children should sit in rows, be quiet and listen to what the teacher was trying to tell them. The hostility of those teachers was such that I was almost booed out of the room. I could understand their not liking what I said, but I did not retract it because I happened to think it was right, and I think we are now starting to recognise again that it is right.<a name="stpa_o314"></a><a name="80114-0016.htm_para17"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Kelvin Hopkins"--><a name="08011467000068"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="737"-->I also believe that there is something different about Britain, in comparison with other European Union countries. Statistics from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development show that five years ago the top 10 per cent. of our academic achievers were among the best in the world, while the bottom 10 per<br><meta name="Date" content="14 Jan 2008"><notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_738"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 738</b><br>cent. were among the worst in the world, or at least in the OECD areas. The disparity between the two was enormous, which shows that something was profoundly wrong.<a name="stpa_o315"></a><a name="80114-0016.htm_para18"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Kelvin Hopkins"--><a name="08011467000069"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="738"-->There are other factors in Britain—other social phenomena—which make us very different from other countries. It was revealed recently that the teenage pregnancy rate in Britain is six times higher than that in Holland. In other respects Britain and Holland are very similar countries, with similar populations, a fairly large proportion of minorities and diverse communities, but there is something different about Britain. We have not really got to the bottom of what the problems are, and we ought to start doing some deep research comparing ourselves with similar countries in Europe to find out what they are.<a name="stpa_o316"></a><a name="80114-0016.htm_para19"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Kelvin Hopkins"--><a name="08011467000070"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="738"-->In the 1980s and 1990s, I read a lot about the comparisons between educational achievement in other European countries and in Britain. Some research was done by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research under Professor Sig Prais; Lord Moser was also involved. Even the abilities of those who were apparently doing well were compared. When apprentice plumbers in France and England were given a simple mathematics test, it was found that all the French plumbers could do all the sums quickly—in five minutes—and none of the British plumbers could do any of the sums at all. There was something profoundly wrong with what was happening.<a name="stpa_o317"></a><a name="80114-0016.htm_para20"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Kelvin Hopkins"--><a name="08011467000071"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="738"-->We have talked about functional illiteracy and functional innumeracy, and contrasted the UK with other countries. The Moser report, published only seven years ago, suggested that 50 per cent. of people here were functionally innumerate, whereas the Leitch report suggests a much lower number. If half the population cannot compute properly, there is a serious problem. We are not just talking about 10 per cent.; it is broader than that.<a name="stpa_o318"></a><a name="80114-0016.htm_para21"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Kelvin Hopkins"--><a name="08011467000072"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="738"-->I may have mentioned before the fact that I worked as a researcher in a trade union before I came into this House. Occasionally, some of the negotiators would sneak into my office and ask me to tell them precisely how one calculates a percentage. These people were negotiating percentages for thousands of members, but they were asking me to tell them how to calculate a percentage. These people were graduates, yet they could not calculate a percentage—something was wrong.<a name="stpa_o319"></a><a name="80114-0016.htm_para22"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Kelvin Hopkins"--><a name="08011467000073"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="738"-->We are not facing up to the difficulties. We do very well with the top 10 per cent. and very badly with the bottom 10 per cent, but many problems lie in the middle group. I hope that when we examine apprenticeships and extending education and training from 16 to 18—it is right to do that—we will look rather more widely than just at the people with obvious and glaring problems, and get to the bottom of what our real educational problems are.<a name="st_o310"></a><a name="08011467000074"></a>

I am talking about another Sig Prais bit of research, which was shown on television about 15 years ago and which compared kitchen manufacturers in Germany and in Britain. The shop floor workers in Germany would take an order in English and translate it without difficulty into a custom-made kitchen arrangement for an order for Britain, including all the calculating and measuring. They contrasted that with the situation in Britain, where not only did the workers not have a clue about any foreign language, but they did not even do their own calculations. People in the office did the calculations and the workers did the routine cutting. There was a sharp contrast, even among skilled workers, between Germany and Britain. I have spent some time travelling around Europe with the Industry and Parliament Trust to look at industry, and there are marked differences. Things are improving in Britain, but we have some way to go.<a name="stpa_o321"></a><a name="80114-0016.htm_para24"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Kelvin Hopkins"--><a name="08011467000079"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="739"-->I may incur the wrath of all primary school teachers if I say that 35 years ago 60 per cent. of primary school teachers in Britain had failed O-level maths, but they were still responsible for teaching the elements of mathematics to all our children. That was very worrying. O-level maths may not be necessary in junior schools, but if teachers are so uncomfortable with mathematics that they cannot pass O-level, they will not be very confident communicating the subject to children in school. I know that we have moved on from there, but this country still has a serious problem with mathematics and basic literacy, and I hope that the Government will address that in future.<a name="st_o314"></a><a name="08011467000080"></a>

Far too many young people in my constituency decide to leave school at 16. They are able and bright, but school has not worked for them and they want to get a job to earn some money. They end up in low-skilled jobs, such as working at a till in a supermarket. I shall not name any particular supermarkets, but a number of those young people go to work in the retail sector. For a short time in their life, they do better than their peer group. They earn £200 to £300 a week and have all the luxuries that those left behind at school do not have. They have a car, status, a job and money to go out with, but they have no long-term skills and no future.

This country has traditionally placed academic success over vocational and industrial success. We need to start redressing that imbalance. There is an urge to send hundreds of thousands of people to university, almost to the exclusion of vocational careers. I stress to the hon.

We could present the argument to young people that those who want to be mechanics or around engineering projects need to have a good understanding of English to read the manuals and of science and maths to do the equations. If we can persuade them that they can apply what they learn in school to a career that enables them to achieve their potential afterwards, perhaps we can engage them in the learning process for that much longer. We should be in a position when young people are 13 or 14 to identify those youngsters who are better off in a vocational framework and help them get the education and experience that will allow them to be productive members of society.<a name="stpa_o331"></a><a name="80114-0017.htm_para9"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Walker"--><a name="08011467000094"></a>

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="743"-->I applaud the Government for taking the bold step of guaranteeing training or education for every young person up to the age of 18. Much has been said about the great sadness of the fact that so many of our young people leave education and training without qualifications. That undoubtedly reduces their life chances. Labour Members hold the view, which should be welcomed, that if we want young people to leave school with qualifications, we must will the means as well as the end. It is simply not enough to stand up in the Chamber and wish that more of our young people stayed on at school. We must not only encourage them to do so; I feel strongly that we must insist.<a name="stpa_o335"></a><a name="80114-0017.htm_para13"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Roberta Blackman-Woods"--><a name="08011467000099"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="743"-->The policy is not simply to ensure that young people stay on in education until the age of 18; it is to ensure a whole range of measures and opportunities for young people and to encourage them to stay on in education or training as well as insisting that they do so. They will be given a range of ways to acquire skills, from work-based learning to apprenticeships. They will be able to combine training and volunteering and participate in part-time education as well as being employed.<a name="stpa_o336"></a><a name="80114-0017.htm_para14"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Roberta Blackman-Woods"--><a name="08011467000100"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="743"-->Having that range of measures is a critical part of the Bill. They reflect what already takes place in a great many communities throughout this country. As a result of previous legislation by this Government, 14-to-19 partnerships exist in lots of areas. They are critical to skills development, because they bring together people at the local level who understand education, particularly the educational requirements of that age group, and marry those requirements with employers' needs in the new diplomas.<a name="stpa_o337"></a><a name="80114-0017.htm_para15"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Roberta Blackman-Woods"--><a name="08011467000101"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="743"-->We want to encourage as many young people as possible to take up the new vocational diplomas. It is clearly important for us to do so, for a number of reasons. I shall start with the young people themselves. Although I must stress that the number of those leaving school without any qualifications has decreased drastically under this Government, we all recognise that there is a group of young people who are disengaged from education—it usually happens between the ages of 12 and 14. That suggests that we do not have enough measures in place to engage them.<a name="stpa_o338"></a><a name="80114-0017.htm_para16"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Roberta Blackman-Woods"--><a name="08011467000102"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="743"-->The Bill's measures to strengthen local partnerships for 14-to-19 diplomas should encourage a great many more young people to take a vocational route through education—a route that will meet their needs. I encourage the Government, when putting in place the element of compulsion, to consider the quality of the 14-to-19 diplomas and work-based training available, so that young people get support and encouragement to stay on in education. We must ensure a degree of personalised support so that they can map out at the age of 11 or 12 what they would like to achieve and receive support to attain it, as well as a degree of flexibility and choice at the local level so that they can start to participate in a diploma and, if they like it, enhance their learning by progressing from apprenticeship to advanced apprenticeship.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="744"-->I support the Bill. The measures in it will help us to engage that group of young people who are leaving without qualifications.<a name="stpa_o340"></a><a name="80114-0017.htm_para18"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Roberta Blackman-Woods"--><a name="08011467000104"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="744"-->I want to give a few examples from my constituency, which is in a former coalfield, to show how the proposals in the Bill may develop. In the 1980s, the mines closed and there was very little investment in the community or its schools. We must therefore do what we can to change the culture of such communities so that young people can improve their aspirations. Such initiatives have been under way for a number of years, and staying-on rates in County Durham have increased drastically in recent years. I pay tribute to local head teachers and teachers who have embraced the need to raise standards, and do a great deal of excellent work with young people to encourage as many of them as possible to stay on.<a name="stpa_o341"></a><a name="80114-0017.htm_para19"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Roberta Blackman-Woods"--><a name="08011467000105"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="744"-->Today, however, we are concentrating on that group who have not grasped the many opportunities provided by the Government. We need to engage with those young people who have not yet seen a way forward in the education system. From talking to them, particularly the young men, I know that they think that in the past their communities were forgotten. They have begun to see that a range of opportunities are available to them, and apprenticeships are the way forward. Many of their fathers and grandfathers undertook apprenticeships, so they know that they were a route to employment in the past. They recognise the language, and they are keen to take them up.<a name="stpa_o342"></a><a name="80114-0017.htm_para20"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Roberta Blackman-Woods"--><a name="08011467000106"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="744"-->I am pleased that the Bill sets out the way forward to provide an increased number of apprenticeships. It pays attention, too, to the quality of apprenticeships on offer, so that young people who take them up gain experience of employment and receive support from employers and local colleges. We must ensure that apprenticeships are a positive experience. Young people should be encouraged to stick with them, and they should lead to employment. That is very much the Leitch agenda, and that is why I support the Bill.<a name="stpa_o343"></a><a name="80114-0017.htm_para21"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Roberta Blackman-Woods"--><a name="08011467000107"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="744"-->While it is important to upskill young people and ensure that they leave education and training with the right qualifications to equip them for the labour market of the future, we must recognise that a great many people in employment do not have the necessary skills for an improving economy. It is right that the Government have encouraged people without level 2 or level 3 qualifications to take up the opportunity to gain them, and have given them the support to do so while they are in employment. I applaud the Government for providing adults with opportunities to take level 3 qualifications that do not require payment. A great many of my constituents did not have the opportunity to gain qualifications early in their lives, and they very much welcome the opportunity to upskill offered by the Bill.<a name="08011467000135"></a>In many workplaces across my constituency and elsewhere, many of our trade union partners have put in place training schemes to encourage workers to upskill, to improve their skills, and to think through<br><meta name="Date" content="14 Jan 2008"><notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_745"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 745</b><br>their career development. Those opportunities were not available to those workers in the past, and I am sure that they all welcome the excellent measures in the Bill that encourage them to develop their skills, enhance their employment level and move into new careers, if that is what they wish to do.<a name="stpa_o344"></a><a name="80114-0017.htm_para22"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Roberta Blackman-Woods"--><a name="08011467000108"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="745"-->Therefore, I applaud the Government for setting their sights high. It is not good enough that we are currently not one of the top 10 OECD countries for skills development. The measures in the Bill and the targets that the Government have set should enable us to get into that top 10 by 2020. We absolutely have to support that ambition. We absolutely want to be a country that invests not only in the skills development of our young people, but in the skills development of adults who are in work, so that, as I said, we can compete effectively in the global economy.<a name="stpa_o345"></a><a name="80114-0017.htm_para23"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Dr. Roberta Blackman-Woods"--><a name="08011467000109"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="745"-->I am at a loss to understand why the Opposition parties are not supporting these measures. Much of the Bill is about changing the culture that exists in some of our communities and giving opportunities for young people. There is much more about that than there is about compulsion. The Government want compulsion as a measure of last resort. The Bill is about providing more opportunities not only for young people but for all adults who are in employment. There is a set of goals and ambitions here that all parties in the Chamber should get behind. I will be interested to hear what Opposition Front Benchers say in response to the debate.<a name="ordayhd_20"></a><a name="80114-0017.htm_ordayhd2"></a><a name="08011467000148"></a><h5 align="left">9.6 pm</h5><a name="st_o320"></a><a name="08011467000110"></a>

Across the House, it is a target that we can all head towards. She also spoke with passion about diplomas. That allows me to declare an interest in the sense that I am the product of the international baccalaureate. I did not do A-levels. If there is any form of education that arms individuals, no matter what their background and what they want to do with their lives, the international baccalaureate and its diploma is it. We should allow more of that. It does not demand that individual pupils limit themselves to three subjects.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="745"-->The greater competition that we now face is part of the background that we are discussing today. It has been mentioned a number of times by hon. Members on both sides of the House. We have heard about the growth in skill sets that we are seeing across Europe, whether it be Poland or elsewhere, the influx of graduates, non-graduates and those armed with the skills in places such as China, India and South Korea.<br><meta name="Date" content="14 Jan 2008"><notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_746"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 746</b><br>We are no longer simply the United Kingdom. We are competing with our colleagues from across the globe. That leads us on to the economic case. Unless we arm the next generation with the relevant skills, as the Leitch report said in December 2005, we will miss out on the importance of investment in education, which leads to a more prosperous labour market.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="746"-->I turn to the detail of the Bill. As has been said many times from the Opposition Benches, the Bill is full of good ideas, but unfortunately it is spoilt by the common denominator of obligation. Sixteen to 18-year olds must participate in full-time education, work-based training such as apprenticeships, or part-time education and training. That seems an honourable<br><meta name="Date" content="14 Jan 2008"><notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_747"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 747</b><br>proposal, but how will we deliver it in practice?

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="747"-->The details will be scrutinised in Committee, but the burden will actually fall on local authorities. Where will the money come from and how will local authorities meet the costs? I am reminded of John F. Kennedy's statement in the early '60s that he wanted to put a man on the moon. He knew full well that it probably would not be his Administration who would pay for putting a man on the moon. The Bill puts us in a similar situation; it promotes an idea that will not come into effect until 2013—conveniently beyond the budgetary requirements we shall be dealing with over the next few years.<a name="stpa_o352"></a><a name="80114-0018.htm_para2"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Ellwood"--><a name="08011467000121"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="747"-->We do not know what the costs will be, but we know that they will fall on local authorities. Authorities such as Bournemouth already carry a hefty burden; they have to pay for extra police and fire duties. In Bournemouth, six fire stations will shut unless our local authority coughs up the money because the national grant from the Government has been sliced. Likewise, many honourable targets, such as those for recycling, have been proposed. Of course we should have such targets, but there is no extra funding from the Government to support local authorities in meeting them. I suspect that the same thing will happen with the Bill; local authorities will have to cough up the funding themselves.<a name="stpa_o353"></a><a name="80114-0018.htm_para3"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Ellwood"--><a name="08011467000122"></a>

Their attendance will be monitored and the local authority will even have power to issue warning orders to inform parents that their son or daughter has not been attending the course, but who will judge whether they pass it? If people simply have to attend—rather than pass—the courses, what good will be done for the economy in the long run?

Either way, the taxpayer will pick up the tab: if we do nothing, the taxpayer will pick up the bill through the criminal justice system or through the national health service; if we want to do something, and create a more cohesive, economically successful and egalitarian society in which opportunities are more equally spread, investing in education now will pay dividends for the taxpayer in years to come. Raising the participation rate is an important step forward. I congratulate the Government on their courage and welcome the fact that the Opposition have finally agreed not to oppose it, even if they are not yet completely convinced of all aspects of the Bill.<a name="stpa_o361"></a><a name="80114-0018.htm_para11"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. David Chaytor"--><a name="08011471000010"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="749"-->It is interesting that last week the Opposition made a great deal of noise about another aspect of education and skills policy: the change to the ELQ—equivalent or lower qualification—arrangements in higher education. Now that they seem to have understood the principle behind the raising of the participation rate, I hope that as time goes by they will make the link between the two. Last week, they were defending the status quo and the current distribution of public spending to a particular privileged group; this week, the Government are trying to extend opportunities to the majority. We have to make the connections between the two—unless the hon. Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) believes that there is an infinite amount of public investment available, and I do not see a Government of his party coming up with increased investment that would pay for both policies.<a name="st_o332"></a><a name="08011471000011"></a>

I hope that as the Bill goes through Committee the Government will carefully consider the implementation of level 2 and level 3 entitlements. The Bill refers to entitlements for a full level 2 or full level 3 qualification, but the difficulty is that many people between the ages of 19 and 25 are not in a position to acquire a full level 3 entitlement all at one go. I hope that as the debate progresses we might consider extending that policy so that the entitlement applies to individual components of level 3 qualifications for people who do not already have one.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="749"-->In respect of the extension of apprenticeships, there has been a huge improvement not only in completion rates but in the total number of young people participating in them. We now have 250,000 successful apprenticeships—almost a threefold increase since the Conservatives were last in power. In a country where<br><meta name="Date" content="14 Jan 2008"><notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_750"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 750</b><br>the work force are increasingly encouraged and required to be mobile, the portability of apprenticeships will become increasingly important. One of the reasons why, in the past, take-up and completion rates of apprenticeships have not been as good as we might wish is that many young people had difficulty in transferring their apprenticeships to new employers. Just as we need to deal with the components of full level 3 qualifications if the level 3 entitlement is to be implemented successfully, we need to look seriously at how the apprenticeship system can be made more portable.<a name="stpa_o364"></a><a name="80114-0018.htm_para14"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Chaytor"--><a name="08011471000015"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="750"-->I welcome the fact that local authorities have been given a more strategic planning role over the 14-to-19 sector. That will involve great responsibilities, and it will link in with the Building Schools for the Future programme. We need to think carefully about where students attend their studies—not only those who are currently inclined to stay on beyond the age of 16 but those who will be encouraged and required to do so in future. I sense that deep in the bowels of the Department for Children, Schools and Families, or in the former Department for Education and Skills, someone came up with the idea that it was possible for young people to carry out their studies at a range of different institutions. To accept that that idea is inevitable does not match the reality of young people's behaviour. It is entirely possible for young people to split their week between more than one institution—a college or an employer, a school or a college, or possibly between a school, college and an employer. However, let us be realistic. We are talking about some of the least well motivated young people in the country and it is utterly naive to assume that they can be expected to have the responsibility and discipline to criss-cross their town or city on a number of different bus routes to attend different institutions.<a name="stpa_o365"></a><a name="80114-0018.htm_para15"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Chaytor"--><a name="08011471000016"></a>

It is a little theoretical to assume that the future pattern of all 14-to-19 studies will be for young people to move among a variety of institutions.

It stands in my name, and is entitled “Climate change and concessionary travel schemes for young people”. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will know that in London, free travel is already available for all young people up to the age of 18. It seems to me an entirely logical extension of the Government's policy of raising the participation age to 17, and then to 18, to make concessionary travel part of their package of measures. The Opposition have made great play of their concern about compulsion and put emphasis on the importance of incentives, and I hope that they can be persuaded that one of the biggest incentives for young people to continue participation in education and training is the provision of free travel.<a name="stpa_o367"></a><a name="80114-0018.htm_para17"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Chaytor"--><a name="08011471000018"></a>

It would give a major boost to public transport. It would set the habits of travel for a lifetime if young people found it was much easier and cheaper to get around on public transport than it was to use private vehicles. If they use public transport at that age, they are more likely to continue to do so as they grew older. I understand that that matter is not the responsibility of the Bill, but I wanted to take the opportunity to urge my hon. and right hon. Friends to discuss it with the Secretary of State for Transport. One of the Government's great successes in this Parliament has been the introduction of a concessionary travel scheme for retired people, and the logical extension of the policies in the Bill is a nationwide concessionary travel scheme for young people.<a name="ordayhd_22"></a><a name="80114-0018.htm_ordayhd1"></a><a name="08011471000178"></a><h5 align="left">9.27 pm</h5><a name="st_o334"></a><a name="08011471000019"></a>

He referred to the 1918 Act—passed by a Liberal-Conservative coalition—which he said introduced the proposal to require compulsory schooling up to 14 and 16.

The then Government decided, partly because of public expenditure pressures, that they could not afford to make the scheme a national, compulsory one. They instead gave local authorities, which then as now had a lot of responsibility for education, the ability to decide whether to oblige employers to provide their employees with some day release education.<a name="stpa_o369"></a><a name="80114-0018.htm_para19"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Willetts"--><a name="08011471000023"></a>

However, the boundaries of London extended only as far north as the Edgware road. North of that was Middlesex, which made no such requirement of employers, the result of which was<br><meta name="Date" content="14 Jan 2008"><notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_752"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 752</b><br>a significant problem—namely, that employers found that they would much rather recruit young people who lived north of the Edgware road than those who lived south of it.

He reminded us that we share the same aspirations in all parts of the House. The puzzle for the Secretary of State must surely be why, despite his aspirations, this Labour Government have fallen so far short of the promises that were made before the 1997 election. If he believed half of what was promised about the new deal, surely he would not have believed that, 10 years on, 16 to 18-year-olds would be facing the problems that the Government themselves honestly acknowledged when they tried to defend their policy.<a name="stpa_o371"></a><a name="80114-0018.htm_para21"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Willetts"--><a name="08011471000027"></a>

According to the Government, the figures show an increase from 76.8 per cent. in 1997 to 77.3 per cent. in 2006. In other words, if I rounded the figures, the Government would appear to have got nowhere at all, but I am trying to give them the benefit of the doubt, so there seems to have been a 0.5 per cent. improvement in participation in education and training.<a name="stpa_o373"></a><a name="80114-0018.htm_para23"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Willetts"--><a name="08011471000029"></a>

However, the other components of education and training—work-based learning and employer-provided training—have seen a decline in the number of 16 to 18-year-olds enjoying those opportunities.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="753"-->I was making my way through the statistics, but I realise that what we really need is a learned article in the<i> Financial Times</i> by an economic expert analysing these data in the way that the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families used to do so skilfully in his previous employment. I am trying to make sense of what has been happening. There has been virtually no change in the number of 16 to 18-year-olds having some education in employment and, within that, there has been a modest increase in the number staying on at school and a decline in the number having training. If anything, there has been an increase in the number of young people not in education, employment or training—NEETs. The number of 16 to 18-year-old NEETs has gone up since 1997 from 173,000 to 197,000, and there has been a decline in the number of young people in work.<a name="stpa_o375"></a><a name="80114-0019.htm_para1"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Willetts"--><a name="08011471000035"></a>

We need the Government to explain why the proposals in the Bill will not simply reinforce those trends, but they have not done so today. Will the Secretary of State tell us whether the way in which the measures take effect will lead to a further decline in the number of young people in employment, perhaps a further decline in the number in employment who are getting a contribution towards training from their employer, and an increase in the number staying on at school? He kept saying, “Don't worry, this is not really an increase in the school leaving age. This is something much more mature and sophisticated than that. It's an increase in the number of young people who will have an entitlement to education or training in some form.”<a name="stpa_o376"></a><a name="80114-0019.htm_para2"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Willetts"--><a name="08011471000036"></a>

That is what the trends established under this Government suggest will happen. Why should it be any different in the future? We have not yet heard any explanation from the Secretary of State as to why that will not happen. The Secretary of State's own advisers have issued a warning about this in their excellent and<br><meta name="Date" content="14 Jan 2008"><notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_754"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 754</b><br>useful report on raising the participation age in education and training.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="754"-->The Secretary of State says, “It's all right, there are going to be more apprenticeships,” but what does he mean by “apprenticeships”? We are worried that some of the things that the Government call apprenticeships look awfully like the job training schemes of our day that they used to denounce. The more the Secretary of State or the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills guarantees an increase in the number of apprenticeships—and the more they both say that they can deliver such an increase—the greater the risk that the only apprenticeships they deliver will involve people sitting behind desks in FE colleges. The more real an apprenticeship is, and the more genuinely it involves real employers, and not just training providers, the less likely it is that the Government will stand here and announce some notional target for them. The whole point about real apprenticeships is that their numbers are not determined by Ministers. So every time Ministers come here to announce some ambitious target for apprenticeships, the more sceptical we become about whether they will be real apprenticeships, or whether the Government will have to deliver their target through schemes that are not apprenticeships in the commonly accepted sense of the word at all.<a name="stpa_o378"></a><a name="80114-0019.htm_para4"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Willetts"--><a name="08011471000038"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="754"-->If young people stay on at school, we want them to get valuable qualifications. That is an objective shared by all of us on both sides of the House. However, as we know from the evaluations by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, another real source of concern is that some national vocational qualifications are of negligible value. It would be a cruel trick to play on our young people to require them to stay on at school to get vocational qualifications, some of which even—shockingly—have a negative value. We have not heard anything from Ministers about why national vocational qualifications are going to be better.<a name="stpa_o379"></a><a name="80114-0019.htm_para5"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Willetts"--><a name="08011471000039"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="754"-->Of course it is good if people stay on at school, but they must not simply be warehoused in education, becoming, in reality, even more disengaged from it. Will the Secretary of State confirm, for example, that when areas in which education maintenance allowances were piloted were compared with those where there were no such allowances, there was a higher number of 19-year-old NEETs in the former? People stayed on at school for an extra two years on account of the incentive, but it left them even more disenchanted than they were before.<a name="stpa_o380"></a><a name="80114-0019.htm_para6"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Willetts"--><a name="08011471000040"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="754"-->Let me come on to some other questions. My hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove) eloquently raised the issue of coercion and how the proposals would work out. In some extremely valuable exchanges, we tried to pin Ministers down as to exactly what coercion would mean. By the end of it, it seemed to mean a fine, but I have to say to the Secretary of State, who I know is wrestling with the problems of the quality of childhood and the opportunities facing our children in Britain today, that youngsters whose lives are going off the rails gradually discover that everything the authorities tell them is a bluff and can be ignored. They find that no threat from the authorities needs to be taken seriously, so ultimately they can carry on playing truant and carry on skiving.<br><meta name="Date" content="14 Jan 2008"><notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_755"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 755</b><br>As a result of my hon.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="755"-->We also need to know more about the effects on other learners. There could be losers from the policy, especially if it involves greater disruption to the education of other children. What are the arrangements for enforcing it? Are the Government going to track every 16 to 18-year-old to ensure that they are indeed complying with the legislation?<a name="stpa_o382"></a><a name="80114-0019.htm_para8"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Willetts"--><a name="08011471000042"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="755"-->As I said, Conservative Members share the aspiration of having more young people stay on to gain worthwhile education and training. For us, the key elements of that are common sense. First, it means getting the educational basics right and ensuring that young people master the basics. My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) has always been eloquent in the cause of synthetic phonics, and it was good to hear Members on all sides of the House speaking up in favour of them. We know that reaching level 4 at the age of 11 is crucial to avoid being a NEET later on, and crucial to ensuring that people stay on in secondary school. Sadly, if young people do not reach level 4 by 11, the educational opportunities later in their youth will be much reduced.<a name="stpa_o383"></a><a name="80114-0019.htm_para9"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Willetts"--><a name="08011471000043"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="755"-->I believe that managing the transitions for young people—from primary to secondary school and from secondary out into college or training—is also very important, but we heard very little about how this new legislation would change that. Providing proper advice for young people is also crucial so that they know what is going to be worth while for them. We welcome that and look forward to debating it further in Committee. It can be frustrating to attend, as I did, one of the excellent summer schools run by Sir Peter Lampl and the Sutton Trust. One sees youngsters suddenly excited by the prospect of going to university and realising that it could indeed be for them, but when one starts talking about the GCSEs or A-levels they have studied, one has to wonder who on earth in their schools ever thought that such a mix of GCSEs or A-levels could remotely help them to meet the aspirations that they obviously have. Someone failed to give them the careers advice that they were entitled to expect. We therefore very much hope that the Bill will help to tackle that shocking problem. We also hope that it will lead to more real apprenticeships with proper employer involvement—an issue that my hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) cares passionately about. They must be real apprenticeships, but the more real they are, as I said, the less likely it is that Ministers will be able to deliver their glib targets.<a name="stpa_o384"></a><a name="80114-0019.htm_para10"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Willetts"--><a name="08011471000044"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="755"-->Finally, we have heard no mention by Ministers of the extraordinary vitality and success of voluntary initiatives that do not need to use the compulsory power of legislation. This morning I visited a charity, Into University, based in north Kensington and elsewhere in London. It tries to learn some of the lessons from the rather disappointing record of Aimhigher, which has not yet succeeded in spreading university opportunities on the scale that we might have hoped for. It said that of course it is necessary to excite youngsters with the prospect of going to university by introducing them to the university<br><meta name="Date" content="14 Jan 2008"><notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_756"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 756</b><br>experience, but it is necessary to do other things as well: offer practical assistance with homework, enabling them to get work done, perhaps away from a disruptive home environment; provide them with mentoring; and provide them with extra courses to ensure that they can get the A-levels and GCSEs that they need. That was a voluntary initiative and a genuine attempt to improve opportunities for young people in danger of becoming NEETs. There is a lot that the voluntary sector can do—so it is good to see the Secretary of State who has responsibility for the voluntary sector on the Front Bench. I very much hope that the Bill is not a case of lazy policy making turning to compulsion when, in reality, smarter policies could achieve the aspirations shared on both sides of the House.<a name="ordayhd_23"></a><a name="80114-0019.htm_ordayhd0"></a><a name="08011471000179"></a><h5 align="left">9.45 pm</h5><a name="st_o343"></a><a name="08011471000045"></a>

We can be more optimistic about what we have achieved on apprenticeships than he perhaps suggested. There has been an increase not only in the overall number of young people taking part in apprenticeships, but in the number of starts, and particularly, as I said during the debate, in the number of completions successfully undertaken.<a name="stpa_o388"></a><a name="80114-0019.htm_para14"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Denham"--><a name="08011471000051"></a>

One reason for raising the participation age, and indeed for allowing an element of compulsion, is to enable us to support those who might otherwise drop out of the system altogether. There is a whole set of young people who will need additional support in relation to literacy or numeracy, the problems with caring that have been raised today, or abuse of drugs or other substances. The Bill makes it much more likely that those who currently disappear from the system will receive the help that they need to remain in it.<a name="stpa_o391"></a><a name="80114-0019.htm_para17"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Denham"--><a name="08011471000054"></a>

Let me say something about tackling the needs of those under 16, and about reforms that are already taking place in the education system. Only last week, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister hosted a reception at No. 10<br><meta name="Date" content="14 Jan 2008"><notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_758"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 758</b><br>Downing street for the British team in the WorldSkills “olympics” which took place recently in Japan. A number of people were there, including the gold medal winner Gary Tuddenham. The food provided was cooked by chefs from Westminster Kingsway college, all of whom were in pre-16 apprenticeships. They were spending three days a week at school, one day undergoing work experience, and one day receiving college-based training. That type of redesign of the curriculum is already happening throughout the education system to give relevant, interesting and exciting education opportunities to young people who might have found traditional education uninteresting. Too much of today's debate seemed to assume that no such curriculum changes were being made, but they are being made, and the Bill's proposals build on a system that is already much more relevant to the young people about whom we are all concerned.<a name="stpa_o393"></a><a name="80114-0019.htm_para19"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Denham"--><a name="08011471000056"></a>

I mention that to clarify an issue that has caused some confusion in the debate.

It is extraordinary, given everything that has been said, that the Conservatives neither moved a reasoned amendment nor are apparently prepared to vote against this legislation. What they have shown tonight is that they are simply not willing to face up to the reality of the challenge that we face as a country. The group of young people about whom we all are most concerned—those who, despite the efforts we are making, are most likely to reach 16 without the qualifications they need for the rest of their lives—are those who are most likely to end up in crime or doing low-income jobs. Such people may end up thinking that trying to work the benefits system is better than trying to get a job, and they are more likely to have low aspirations for their own children.<a name="stpa_o401"></a><a name="80114-0019.htm_para27"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Denham"--><a name="08011471000068"></a>

The main problem for many students in Cornwall is that while there will, I hope, be many new opportunities, their ability to access them will be severely limited by the lack of transport. Living in rural areas with poor transport links makes it difficult for many young people to travel to schools and colleges. That will lead to rural learners being severely disadvantaged in comparison with those who enjoy—if that is the word—living in urban areas. That difference is one of the principal problems for young people in Cornwall if they are to have any chance of enjoying the new opportunities in the Bill.<a name="stpa_o417"></a><a name="80114-0020.htm_para13"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Colin Breed"--><a name="08011471000087"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="762"-->In July 2007, the rural local authorities transport group undertook a case study—helpfully, it was of Cornwall. It discovered, without too much effort, that Cornwall is a long peninsula surrounded by water and that most transport links run along the spine of the county. The weather is not always as good as it seems in the summer, and we have rain, wind and snow, which make waiting around for public transport more difficult.<a name="stpa_o418"></a><a name="80114-0020.htm_para14"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Colin Breed"--><a name="08011471000088"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="762"-->Journey times vary enormously, especially from the far east, west and north of the county. Some journeys involve multiple use of buses, and it can take some students as much as two hours at the beginning of the day and two hours at the end of the day. The other problems of low wages and high house prices, not to mention the general cost of living in Cornwall, have made the cost of transport a heavy burden for many people. Indeed, some families simply cannot afford the cost of local buses at current prices.<a name="stpa_o419"></a><a name="80114-0020.htm_para15"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Colin Breed"--><a name="08011471000089"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="762"-->The council transport budget is now some £11 million, of which £1.2 million is for post-16 requirements. Only £400,000 of that is recouped through charges. The figure is low, but it represents about as much as can be recouped. The local authority offers a bus pass at £225 a year. That might well be below the national average but, for Cornwall, it is extremely expensive. It does not cover the true cost even of providing the transport, which is estimated at nearly £800. The whole system is being squeezed to keep costs down—the cheapest buses, the longest routes and little that is direct and point to point.<a name="stpa_o420"></a><a name="80114-0020.htm_para16"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Colin Breed"--><a name="08011471000090"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="762"-->Train travel is not helpful either. In my constituency, students who want to access the good educational facilities in Truro can get on a train at Lostwithiel in the morning to get there at a reasonable time but, of course, the train coming back does not stop at Lostwithiel and goes on to Bodmin. It goes past Lostwithiel, where they would like to get off, down to Bodmin where they have to wait for three quarters of an hour to get a train back.<a name="stpa_o421"></a><a name="80114-0020.htm_para17"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Colin Breed"--><a name="08011471000091"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="762"-->The arrangements do not appear to be sustainable. They will certainly not be sustainable if the provisions in the Education and Skills Bill come into being—certainly not with existing budgets and charges. An<br><meta name="Date" content="14 Jan 2008"><notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_763"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 763</b><br>increasing number of students are taking transport that has been arranged by colleges, and without those services the council could not retain current levels of support and contributions. The system is beginning to creak—it has been creaking for some while—but we want to enable our teenage students in Cornwall to access the educational facilities that are provided for them.<a name="stpa_o422"></a><a name="80114-0020.htm_para18"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Colin Breed"--><a name="08011471000092"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="763"-->As I said, the Government are increasingly allowing the burden of transport delivery to fall on local authorities and colleges. That might be all right in the short term, but the approach has not been a short-term one and the problem is getting worse. Additional funding is needed because, without that, the moneys that are spent on transport will be taken from the education budget. Education will therefore be the loser in order to provide for the additional transport costs.<a name="stpa_o423"></a><a name="80114-0020.htm_para19"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Colin Breed"--><a name="08011471000093"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="763"-->The main source of Government funding used to be the learner support funds, but they have now been replaced, by and large, by the education maintenance allowance, which is welcome. However, where are the funds for transport subsidies? Is it fair that our students in Cornwall—the rural learners—have to spend a substantial part of their education maintenance allowance getting to and from school or college? In London, students get their transport free, and can spend their EMA on whatever they like.<a name="stpa_o424"></a><a name="80114-0020.htm_para20"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Colin Breed"--><a name="08011471000094"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="763"-->Waiting for buses is often seen as an act of faith, and we need to redress that so that bus transport is seen as the quick and easy alternative to the car. Far too many times, students wait around only to find that the service has been cancelled. Many learners use the council travel scheme merely as a stepping stone to buying a car. The problem is not so much the fact that buying a car can be very expensive, with all the problems that running it can cause. If the 25,000 16 to 19-year-olds in Cornish colleges were thinking of using their own vehicles, there would be not only major environmental implications but increased accident rates. Inexperienced 17 and 18-year-olds who learned to drive at the first opportunity would be on very narrow roads, sometimes in slippery conditions. I am sure that I do not have to paint any more of a picture.<a name="stpa_o425"></a><a name="80114-0020.htm_para21"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Colin Breed"--><a name="08011471000095"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="763"-->The whole bus pricing structure needs overhauling. How can we have free travel for young people in London, whereas in Cornwall they sometimes have to pay as much as £5 or £6 a day? Our local bus companies simply do not compete with each other. They stick to their own routes and have no incentive to buy better buses. They need to get more buses on the road to increase that flexibility, reliability and comfort.<a name="stpa_o426"></a><a name="80114-0020.htm_para22"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Colin Breed"--><a name="08011471000096"></a>

Everything about that Bill demonstrates the Government's commitment to ensuring that all young people are given the maximum opportunity to succeed.

From the urban heart of our big cities to the fields and farms of our shire counties, all young people, regardless of where in England they live, should have an equal chance to take advantage of the learning options that are right for them.

We are certainly alive to the challenges that rural areas will face, and I want to explain the considerable efforts that we are making to meet them. When we discuss teenage travel, we are generally referring to post-16 learners. The home-to-school arrangements for pre-16 travel are well understood and were improved in the Education and Inspections Act 2006. However, we know that post-16 learners, including those in Cornwall, are more likely to have to contribute to their travel costs, and it is not uncommon for young people who are affected by the issue to use their own car to get to lessons, if they are old enough.<a name="stpa_o441"></a><a name="80114-0021.htm_para0"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Jim Knight"--><a name="08011471000114"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="765"-->Clearly, it is essential that young people who are not lucky enough or old enough to have their own car can access the facilities and instruction that they need to pursue their chosen path. The issue is partly about developing good public transport. Local authorities already have a duty to draw up a transport policy statement for young people, and the Education and Skills Bill may create further demand for services, as the hon. Gentleman said. It also includes a clause that will require all local authorities to pay attention to travel time, distance and cost when setting out their plans. I hope that that will start to address the issues<br><meta name="Date" content="14 Jan 2008"><notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_766"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 766</b><br>highlighted in the examples that he gave of individuals having to travel for two hours each way to access education.<a name="st_o355"></a><a name="08011471000115"></a>

Only one of the eight state secondary schools in my constituency has a sixth form, so there is a great deal of travel from villages and towns to get to post-16 provision. On the Isles of Scilly, transport is provided in a different way. In fact, the Government have been very helpful in ensuring that Scillonians can get to post-16 provision. Does the Minister not accept that there are specific needs and circumstances that the Government need to allow for in the budget provided to local education authorities, so that those LEAs can meet their statutory obligations?<a name="st_o358"></a><a name="08011471000121"></a>

That is why the Isles of Scilly are relative well funded, per pupil—to try to take account of circumstances there. When we enact the legislation, subject to parliamentary approval, we do not propose to implement an increase in participation in education overnight. We propose to wait until 2013 for 17-year-olds, and 2015 for 18-year-olds. That is necessary, as a range of reforms must be introduced if the policy is to work and if we are not to criminalise a legion of young people. Equally, it allows us time to look at local circumstances and difficulties in areas facing special challenges such as the Isles of Scilly—I represent some islands in my constituency—to determine how they can fulfil their obligations so that every young person has the opportunity to fulfil their duty in the proposed legislation to participate in education until the age of 18.<a name="stpa_o445"></a><a name="80114-0021.htm_para4"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Jim Knight"--><a name="08011471000122"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="766"-->As I said, local authorities already have a duty to draw up a transport policy statement for young people, and I have referred to the relevant clause in the Education and Skills Bill.

Some people have called for free or subsidised transport for all post-16 learners—perhaps a 24/7 scheme so that they could access the public transport network for free—all the time. I was interested in the rural transport steering group paper entitled, “Rural transport—long distance learners? Transport for teenage learners in rural areas”. The picture on the front grabbed my attention, because it showed a young woman waiting for a bus to Weymouth. It was a well chosen picture—I assume that it was taken in my constituency—and I had a useful meeting with the report's authors to discuss their proposals.<a name="stpa_o446"></a><a name="80114-0021.htm_para5"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Jim Knight"--><a name="08011471000123"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="767"-->I am mindful, too, of the priority that the Youth Parliament places on the need to secure free transport for young people. I have some sympathy with the proposal, which is simple and clear and, I am confident, would probably improve access to education for some young people. The Government need to keep it under review, but at least two significant obstacles would have to be overcome before I could give it serious consideration. The first, and slightly lesser consideration is cost. There would be a considerable outlay, and there could be a deadweight cost in areas such as London, Cumbria and other authorities that already offer such a service at no charge to young people. However, we might consider it worth paying that cost if it safeguarded access. Secondly, I am concerned that the proposal might not fulfil its purpose for enough young people, and it would not necessarily help those who need it most.<a name="stpa_o447"></a><a name="80114-0021.htm_para6"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Jim Knight"--><a name="08011471000124"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="767"-->Free public transport is helpful only if it is convenient and timely. There is no point in having such a subsidy if someone lives miles away from a bus that comes along only once a day. The hon. Member for South-East Cornwall gave a similar example regarding train services. The scheme would have to be administratively robust, help those who most need it and keep people engaged in learning.<a name="st_o359"></a><a name="08011471000125"></a>

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="767"-->Such a scheme might work for certain areas, but I have yet to be convinced that it would achieve a universal impact. I wish to stress the fact that many “non-transport” solutions have been successfully introduced across the country. Effective e-learning, for instance, can open up new opportunities for young people to study at their base school or even at home. Shared timetables across an area can reduce the need for transport between institutions during the day, while block timetabling can reduce the number of times a<br><meta name="Date" content="14 Jan 2008"><notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_768"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 768</b><br>young person has to make a longer journey, particularly as we develop diplomas through 14-to-19 partnerships.<a name="stpa_o449"></a><a name="80114-0021.htm_para8"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Jim Knight"--><a name="08011471000128"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="768"-->Mobile teachers or facilities for some courses can help more young people to access subjects at their own school. I see the hon. Member for Teignbridge (Richard Younger-Ross) looking slightly perplexed but there are examples of mobile science labs and mobile facilities that some in the rural pathfinder areas for diplomas have been using and which have been successful. What is crucial in every instance is that we develop a strong collaborative culture within local authorities, with the 14-to-19 team, the transport team and the capital team working together to build a coherent long-term strategy for guaranteeing access to learning.<a name="stpa_o450"></a><a name="80114-0021.htm_para9"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Jim Knight"--><a name="08011471000129"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="768"-->We are committed to finding the solutions for different areas, and we are using the experience and knowledge that we have built up. From the beginning of the 14-to-19 reform programme, we established a number of pathfinders to test out the logistics in pilot areas. Those included rural areas: first Cumbria and Shropshire, and later areas such as Norfolk and Somerset, which is still a distance from Cornwall but is not quite as far away as Cumbria. We have learned a great deal about rural needs from those pathfinders and from those rural areas that subsequently passed through the first diploma gateway. Even more rural consortiums will be delivering from September 2009 after the results of the second diploma gateway are announced in April this year.<a name="stpa_o451"></a><a name="80114-0021.htm_para10"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Jim Knight"--><a name="08011471000130"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="768"-->The Cornwall collegiate is one of those that is set to deliver diplomas from this September. To do so, it has had to demonstrate a robust transport solution that ensures fair access to those courses. Of course, that remains a work in progress and we will need to go further before we reach a situation where we can offer the full range of options in Cornwall and similar areas. Therefore, there is intensive work under way to support the roll-out.<a name="stpa_o452"></a><a name="80114-0021.htm_para11"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Jim Knight"--><a name="08011471000131"></a>
<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="768"-->In Cornwall specifically, we have awarded the consortium £1 million to develop a virtual learning environment to allow distance learning.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="768"-->More broadly, we have an internal project under way that will give us a wealth of information about how to address the access question in different parts of the country, taking into account the different circumstances in which areas find themselves. It will map the character and challenges faced by rural areas around the country and then identify areas with common characteristics.

<!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="768"-->Alongside that, we have asked York Consulting to undertake a research project into 14-to-19 transport. That is not looking exclusively at rural transport issues but clearly that will be a significant issue to be investigated. I will ensure that it is taken seriously because it is a subject in which I am extremely interested. Therefore, we are building considerable knowledge and expertise for dealing with the challenge of rural transport, and local authorities will benefit from that as they build their capabilities for delivering the reforms.<br><meta name="Date" content="14 Jan 2008"><notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><a name="column_769"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 769</b><br><a name="stpa_o455"></a><a name="80114-0021.htm_para14"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Jim Knight"--><a name="08011471000134"></a>
