there's the one I wrote for the cd corpus (if memory serves) based on
the preprocessor written by Philipp Koehn for the europarl corpus.
Unlike Koehn's, my splitter preprocesses for the TCA alignment tool, adding
sentence and paragraph id tags (e.g. <p id='p1'><s id='s1'>...</s><s
id='s2'>...</s></p>)

A tar file containing the splitter (called tagsentences.pl) is attached, along
with a list of prefixes which, when followed by a period character, do *not*
cause a sentence break (directory nonbreaking_prefixes/, which should be
uncompressed in the same directory as tagsentences.pl) for a few languages. This
is somewhat crude but works fairly well in practice.

Here's the usage summary:

 USAGE

  tagsentences.pl [-h] [-l en|de|...] [-e elements] file1 file2 ...

  Files file1, file2, ... will have its sentences which occur between the
  chosen elements tagged. E.g. if you specify -e speech|writing, the
  chunk

    '<speech ref='s1'>this is a sentence. this is another.</speech>'

  will become

    '<speech ref='s1'>
     <p id='p1'><s id='s1'>this is a sentence.</s>
     <s id='s2'>this is another.</s></p>
     </speech>'

  The original files will be save with extension '.tagsentences.pl' (e.g.
  file1.tagsentences.pl etc and file1, ... will
  contain the paragraph/sentence-annotated version.

  OPTIONS:

      -e element Element within whose tags sentences will be split
                 DEFAULT: speech|writing

      -l lang    Splitting will consider non-breaking patterns for
                 language lang. See nonbreaking_prefixes/ directory
                 for available patterns (e.g. nonbreaking_prefix.en,
                 for English language prefixes.
                 DEFAULT: en

      -p par     paragraph identifier. The token that identifies a
                 paragraph break. This could be a markup element, such
                 as <p> or <p/>, a line break, a double line break or
                 anything else you fancy.

                 DEFAULT: \n

      -q         Execute quietly. I.e. do not print progress messages

      -h         Just display this message and quit.

  EXAMPLE:

     tagsentences.pl -f EN20050512.xml -e 'speech|writing'
