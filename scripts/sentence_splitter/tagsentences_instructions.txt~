To tag paragraphs and sentences:
1. Copy the script in the desired folder
2. open the shell
3. cd to the desired folder
4. type perl tagsentences.pl -l en -f *.xml -e 'speech'

In case you remove elements such as empty paragraphs and/or sentences

To renumber elements (paragraphs and sentences, for others no need to do steps 1, 2, 7, 8):

1. Rename paragraphs as <pa instead of <p:
Search for: <p id
Replace by: <pa id
2. Rename sentences as <se instead of <s:
Search for: <s id
Replace by: <se id

Search for: </p>
Replace for. </pa>
Search for: </s>
Replace for. </se>



Then

3. Copy the script in the desired folder
4. open the shell
5. cd to the desired folder
6. type:
6.1. for paragraphs:
for i in `ls *.xml`; do perl xmlnumberer.pl -f $i -e pa -a id -p p -n; done;
6.2. for sentences:
for i in `ls *.xml`; do perl xmlnumberer.pl -f $i -e se -a id -p se -n; done;

Finally

7. Restore paragraphs to the right name:
Search for: <pa id
Replace by: <p id
8. Restore sentences to the right name:
