hi Maria,

for the ep corpus we used:

for i in `ls *.xml`; do perl xmlnumberer.pl -f $i -e intervention -a ref ; done;

to renunmber all ref attributes in all intervention tags of all .xml files in
the directory where the command above was types (assuming xmlnumberer.pl is also
in that directory.

for i in `ls *.xml`; do perl xmlnumberer.pl -f $i -e speech -a ref -p s; done;

does the same for ref attributes of speech elements, but prefixes the number by
's' (ID tags cannot start with a digit).

You may of course also run the script on a single file. E.g.:

perl xmlnumberer.pl -f EN0001.xml -e speech -a ref -p s

-nino
